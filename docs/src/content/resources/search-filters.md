How `search_filters` work in MD focus trees, what every relevant filter means, and how to assign them.

## How Search Filters Work

Each focus can have one or more `search_filters` values. They power the filter buttons in the focus search UI: clicking a filter shows only focuses tagged with it. Every focus **must** have at least one filter.

```
search_filters = { FOCUS_FILTER_POLITICAL FOCUS_FILTER_ISRPOLIT }
```

Multiple filters are space-separated inside the braces, on a single line.

## Two-Layer Convention

Most country trees use a **two-layer** approach:

1. **Country-specific filter**: which country/faction the focus belongs to (e.g. `FOCUS_FILTER_ISRPOLIT`, `FOCUS_FILTER_RUSSIA_ECONOMY`). Always include this.
2. **Generic filter**: the broad category (e.g. `FOCUS_FILTER_POLITICAL`, `FOCUS_FILTER_INDUSTRY`). Makes the focus discoverable through global filter buttons.

Countries using only custom filters are invisible to generic searches. Always include both layers.

**Exception:** Smaller/simpler trees may use only generic filters with no custom ones, this is fine.

## Israel-Specific Filters

Israel uses six custom filters. Every Israel focus needs the ISR custom filter **plus** the corresponding generic filter below.

| ISR Filter                   | Purpose                                                                                               | Paired Generic Filter         |

## Common Mistakes

| Wrong                                                                  | Correct                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only custom filter, no generic                                         | Always add the paired generic (see tables above)                                                                    |
| `FOCUS_FILTER_MILITARY`                                                | Use `FOCUS_FILTER_MILITARY_LAWS` (MILITARY is a legacy/unused alias)                                                |
| Using `FOCUS_FILTER_DIPLOMACY` for all foreign policy                  | Use `FOCUS_FILTER_FOREIGN_POLICY` for general relations; `FOCUS_FILTER_DIPLOMACY` for specific diplomatic actions   |
| Tagging economic investment focuses without `FOCUS_FILTER_EXPENDITURE` | Add `FOCUS_FILTER_EXPENDITURE` to high-cost industrial/economic focuses, and add a bankruptcy guard in `ai_will_do` |
| Missing filter entirely                                                | Every focus must have at least one filter                                                                           |
| Using another country's custom filter                                  | Custom filters (RUSSIA*\*, UKRAINE*\*, ISRPOLIT, etc.) are country-specific, never cross-assign                     |

## Checklist When Adding a New Focus

1. Choose the **country-specific custom filter** matching the focus's branch.
2. Choose the **generic filter** from the tables above (one or two, don't over-tag).
3. For high-cost focuses, add a `factor = 0` modifier in `ai_will_do` conditioned on `has_active_mission = bankruptcy_incoming_collapse`: AI-only, not in `available`. Thresholds: `cost >= 8` for any focus, or `cost >= 5` if tagged military / economy / research. **Why:** at/above these costs the focus commits enough treasury that an AI already in collapse digs deeper; the lower econ/mil/research threshold reflects that those focuses typically chain larger monetary effects alongside the focus cost.
4. Write `search_filters` as a single line: `search_filters = { CUSTOM_FILTER GENERIC_FILTER }`.
