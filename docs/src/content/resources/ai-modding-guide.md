# What the Repo Provides

Millennium Dawn ships with first-class support for AI-assisted development:

| Resource                  | Location                 | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AGENTS.md**             | `/AGENTS.md`             | Repo-wide instructions for AI agents, coding standards, formatting rules, performance patterns, scripting pitfalls             |
| **Claude Code rules**     | `.claude/rules/`         | Detailed rules for localisation, scripted GUIs, general scripting, and more                                                    |
| **Claude Code skills**    | `.claude/skills/`        | Slash commands for common tasks: `/validate`, `/standardize`, `/new-focus`, `/review-branch`, `/audit`, `/fix-issue`, and more |
| **Documentation index**   | `.claude/docs/`          | Deep references for focuses, events, decisions, ideas, MIOs, AI strategy, AI equipment, diplomatic actions, and more           |
| **Validation tools**      | `tools/validation/`      | Python validators that catch common mistakes, run via pre-commit or manually                                                   |
| **Standardization tools** | `tools/standardization/` | Auto-reformatters for focuses, events, decisions, and ideas                                                                    |

These resources are designed to work together. An AI agent reading `AGENTS.md` knows the project's coding standards; the skills let it apply those standards mechanically.

# Tool Options

## Claude Code (Recommended)

[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) is a terminal-based AI assistant that reads the repo context automatically. The team uses it daily.

**Setup:**

1. Install Claude Code from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code).
2. Open a terminal in the Millennium Dawn repo directory.
3. Run `claude`: it reads `AGENTS.md` and `.claude/` automatically.

**Key skills available:**

| Skill          | Command                  | What it does                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validate       | `/validate`              | Run all validators on changed/staged files                 |
| Standardize    | `/standardize <file>`    | Auto-reformat a file to MD conventions                     |
| New focus tree | `/new-focus <TAG>`       | Scaffold a focus tree with stubs and loc keys              |
| Review branch  | `/review-branch`         | Quick standards review of the full branch diff             |
| Content review | `/content-review <file>` | Full quality checklist (economic, political, military, AI) |
| Deep audit     | `/audit <file>`          | Multi-agent audit: simplification + performance + content  |
| Fix issue      | `/fix-issue <number>`    | Find and fix a GitHub issue, open a PR                     |
| Changelog      | `/changelog`             | Summarize branch changes, update Changelog.txt             |

**Typical workflow:**

```bash
# Start Claude Code in the repo
claude

# Ask it to scaffold a focus tree
> /new-focus SER

# Review your changes before committing
> /review-branch

# Validate before pushing
> /validate
```

See [Claude Code Skills](/dev-resources/claude-code-skills/) for the full skill reference.

## GitHub Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) provides inline code suggestions in VS Code and other editors. It works well for HOI4 script completion but does not read repo-specific rules automatically.

**Setup:**

1. Install the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code.
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.

**Best for:** Autocompleting repetitive script patterns, generating boilerplate event/decision/focus blocks.

**Limitations:** Copilot does not know MD-specific conventions (tab indentation, logging requirements, `ai_will_do` patterns). Always review its output against the [Code Stylization Guide](/dev-resources/code-stylization-guide/).

## Local Models with Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) runs large language models locally on your machine. Everything stays offline after the initial model download.

**Benefits:**

- No internet required after setup
- Your code stays private
- Free to use (no API costs)
- Can run continuously for assistance

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh   # macOS/Linux
# Or download from ollama.com/download/windows   # Windows

# Pull a model
ollama pull codellama

# Run interactively
ollama run codellama
```

### Recommended Models

| Model           | Size    | Best For                             |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `codellama`     | 7-13 GB | Code generation, general programming |
| `llama3`        | 4-8 GB  | General conversation, documentation  |
| `mistral`       | 4 GB    | Fast responses, code completion      |
| `qwen2.5-coder` | 2-4 GB  | Specialized for code tasks           |

### Hardware Requirements

| Model Size | RAM Needed | Use Case         |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 4GB        | 8GB+       | Basic assistance |
| 7GB        | 16GB+      | Code generation  |
| 13GB       | 32GB+      | Complex tasks    |

### VS Code Integration

**Continue extension**: full-featured, multi-model support:

1. Install [Continue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue).
2. Configure in `~/.continue/config.json`:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "model": "codellama",
      "provider": "ollama"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Cline extension**: lightweight, direct Ollama integration. Install [Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cline.cline), then configure in VS Code settings (Ctrl/Cmd + , → Extensions → Cline) with the same model config as above. The `baseUrl` is `http://localhost:11434` by default.

### Custom MD Expert Model

Create a model pre-loaded with MD conventions:

```bash
cat > Modelfile << 'EOF'
FROM codellama
PARAMETER temperature 0.3

SYSTEM """
You are an expert Hearts of Iron IV modder specializing in Millennium Dawn.
- Follow MD coding standards: 1 tab indent, logging in effects
- Use MD-specific scripted effects from common/scripted_effects/
- Reference docs in .claude/docs/ for modifiers and effects
- Always include ai_will_do in focus trees
- Use original_tag, not tag, in idea allowed blocks
- Use is_triggered_only = yes for events
"""
EOF

ollama create md-expert -f Modelfile
ollama run md-expert
```

### GPU Acceleration

Ollama uses GPU automatically if available. Verify with `ollama list`: look for the GPU indicator in model info.

### API Server Mode

Run Ollama as an API server for integration with other tools:

```bash
ollama serve    # starts on port 11434

# Query from another terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "codellama",
  "prompt": "How do I add a new idea in MD?",
  "stream": false
}'
```

# Effective Prompts for Modding

Good prompts include context about the mod's conventions. Generic prompts produce generic output.

## Code Review

```
You are reviewing Hearts of Iron IV mod code for Millennium Dawn.
Check for:
1. Correct use of MD-specific scripted effects
2. Performance issues (avoid every_country, MTTH events)
3. Style compliance (1 tab indent, logging in completion_reward)
4. Common errors: wrong scoping, invented modifier names, redundant AND wrappers

Review this code:
[PASTE CODE]
```

## Focus Tree Generation

```
Create a Millennium Dawn focus tree for [COUNTRY].
Rules:
- File: 05_[country]_focus.txt
- Use relative_position_id for positioning
- Include ai_will_do with game rule checks
- Add completion_reward with logging
- Use search_filters (two-layer pattern)
- Prefix focus IDs with TAG_

Country context: [DESCRIBE POLITICAL SITUATION]
```

## Debugging

```
Help debug this HOI4 script error:
[ERROR MESSAGE]

Code context:
[RELEVANT CODE]

Check for:
- Invalid triggers/effects
- Incorrect scope usage (tag vs original_tag)
- check_variable using >= or <= (not valid inline)
- NRY used as logical NRY (it scopes to Norway)
```

## Converting Ideas to Effects

```
Convert this idea definition to use MD's economic effects:
[IDEA CODE]

Use the scripted effects from common/scripted_effects/00_money_system.txt
Include picture = sprite_name and allowed_civil_war = { always = yes }
```

# Common AI Mistakes in HOI4 Scripting

AI models frequently produce these errors. Always check for them:

| Mistake                            | Why it's wrong                                                          | Fix                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Invented modifier names            | AI hallucinates modifiers that don't exist                              | Verify with `grep -r "modifier_name" common/` |
| `tag` in idea `allowed` blocks     | `tag` changes for civil war countries                                   | Use `original_tag`                            |
| Redundant `AND = { }`              | Implicit AND in triggers makes this unnecessary                         | Remove the wrapper                            |
| `check_variable = { v >= 0 }`      | `>=` and `<=` are not valid inline                                      | Use `compare = greater_than_or_equals`        |
| `NOR = { ... }` as logical NOR     | `NRY` is Norway's country tag, not a logic keyword                      | Use separate `NOT` blocks                     |
| Missing `province` on `naval_base` | `add_building_construction` for naval bases requires `province = XXXXX` | Add the province ID                           |
| `is_in_faction = TAG`              | `is_in_faction` is boolean, not a scope check                           | Use `is_in_faction_with = TAG`                |
| `has_trade_agreement_with`         | Not a valid HOI4 trigger                                                | Use `has_country_flag = trade_agreement@TAG`  |
| Empty `on_add = { log = "" }`      | Useless code                                                            | Remove it                                     |
| `cancel = { always = no }`         | Default behavior, adds nothing                                          | Remove it                                     |

Run `/validate` or `pre-commit run --files <path>` to catch these automatically.

# Best Practices

1. **AI output is a draft, not a deliverable.** Review every line before submission.
2. **Verify game objects exist.** AI invents modifier names, scripted effects, and triggers. Grep the codebase to confirm they're real.
3. **Test in-game when possible.** AI cannot run the HOI4 engine; you can.
4. **Use the repo's built-in tools.** The validation hooks and standardization scripts catch what AI misses.
5. **Disclose AI use in PRs.** If a substantial portion was AI-generated, say so in the PR description. This helps reviewers know where to look harder.
6. **Don't paste sensitive info into cloud AI.** Use local models (Ollama) for anything you wouldn't post publicly.
7. **Match the model to the task.** `codellama` for scripts, `llama3` for documentation, smaller models for quick completions.

---

# Troubleshooting (Ollama)

**Slow performance:** Use a smaller model (4GB instead of 13GB). Close other applications to free RAM. Check GPU utilization.

**Out of memory:** Run `free -h` (Linux) or check Activity Monitor (macOS). Kill stale instances with `pkill -f ollama`.

**Model not found:** Re-pull with `ollama pull codellama`. Check installed models with `ollama list`.
