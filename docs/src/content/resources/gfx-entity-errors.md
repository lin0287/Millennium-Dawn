This guide covers the most common `pdx_entity.cpp` and `assetfactory.cpp` errors that appear in the HOI4 error log and how to fix them.

The error log is located at:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/logs/error.log`
- **Windows**: `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/logs/error.log`

## GFX File Structure

Understanding the relationship between file types is essential for diagnosing entity errors.

### File Types

| Extension            | Purpose                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.gfx`               | Declares `pdxmesh` (mesh + animation bindings) and `pdxparticle` references                           |
| `.asset`             | Defines `entity` blocks that reference `pdxmesh` names and wire up states, attachments, and particles |
| `.mesh`              | The raw 3D model file, referenced by `pdxmesh` blocks in `.gfx` files                                 |
| `.asset` (particles) | Defines particle systems referenced by `pdxparticle` in `.gfx` files                                  |

A typical country unit requires two paired files:

```
gfx/entities/
  TAG_MD_infantryandvehicle.gfx    ← declares pdxmesh + animations
  TAG_MD_infantryandvehicle.asset  ← defines entity blocks using those meshes
```

The `.gfx` file links a mesh name to a `.mesh` file and maps animation IDs:

```
pdxmesh = {
    name = "JAP_MDinfantry1_mesh"
    file = "gfx/models/units/infantry/JAP KOR TAI/JAP_MDinfantry_1.mesh"
    animation = { id = "idle"   type = "GER_infantry_mg_idle_animation" }
    animation = { id = "attack" type = "GER_infantry_mg_attack_animation" }
    ...
}
```

The `.asset` file then defines entities that reference that mesh and add states and attach points:

```
entity = {
    name = "JAP_MD4_infantry_2_entity"
    pdxmesh = "JAP_MDinfantry1_mesh"

    state = { name = "idle"   animation = "idle"   ... }
    state = { name = "attack" animation = "attack" ... }

    attach = { name = "rifle1" Right_Hand_node = "JAP_weapon_Type89rifle_right_entity" }
}
```

### File Naming Conventions

| Pattern                                     | Usage                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TAG_MD_infantryandvehicle.asset/.gfx`      | Country infantry and vehicle entities                         |
| `TAG_MD_planes.gfx` + `TAG_planes.asset`    | Country air unit entities                                     |
| `TAG_MD_tanks.gfx` + `TAG_tanks.asset`      | Country armor entities                                        |
| `___MD_infantry_units.asset`                | Shared infantry definitions (triple underscore = loads first) |
| `___MD_tanks_and_vechicles.gfx`             | Shared vehicle mesh declarations                              |
| `units_ships.asset`, `units_infantry.asset` | Vanilla-parallel base files                                   |
| `_BfB_vehicles.asset`, `_LaR_units_*.asset` | Submod/DLC compatibility files                                |
| `MD4_units_ships.asset`                     | MD ship entity overrides/additions                            |

### Clone Entities

Clone blocks create environment-specific variants (snow, desert, default) from a single base entity without duplicating all state definitions:

```
entity = {
    clone = "JAP_MD4_infantry_2_entity"
    name = "JAP_infantry_entity_snow"
    pdxmesh = "JAP_MDinfantry1_mesh"
}
```

The clone inherits all states and attach points from the parent. Only fields explicitly set in the clone block are overridden. **The parent entity must be defined before the clone in load order.**

### Particle Wiring

Particles are declared in `gfx/particles/` as `.asset` files, then registered in a `.gfx` file as a named `pdxparticle`, and finally referenced by that name inside entity `state` event blocks:

```
# gfx/particles/vehicles/sparks.asset
particle = { name="MD_sparks_file" ... }

# gfx/entities/MD_particles.gfx
pdxparticle = { name = "sparks_particle"  type = "MD_sparks_file"  scale = 1 }

# gfx/entities/TAG_MD_infantryandvehicle.asset
state = { name = "attack"  ...
    event = { node="barrel" particle = "sparks_particle" ... }
}
```

### Vanilla File Locations

The vanilla game and each DLC ship their own entity files that are merged with mod files at load time. Always check both locations when diagnosing duplicates:

```
Hearts of Iron IV/gfx/entities/              ← base game
Hearts of Iron IV/dlc/DLC_NAME/gfx/entities/ ← DLC additions
```

Notable DLC entity packs that overlap with MD assets:

| DLC folder                                 | Contents                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `dlc025_axis_armor_pack`                   | Italian, German, Japanese armor entities |
| `dlc036_by_blood_alone`                    | Italian air/vehicle entities             |
| `dlc048_expansion_pass_2_seaplane_tenders` | Commonwealth ship entities               |

## Duplicate Entity

```plaintext
[pdx_entity.cpp:2172]: Duplicate of ITA_mechanized_vehicle_1_entity added to entity system
```

**Cause:** An entity name is defined in both the mod and a vanilla file (base game or DLC). HOI4 merges all `.asset` files at load time, it does not let mod files override vanilla ones.

**How to diagnose:**

1. Search the mod for the entity name:

   ```bash
   grep -rn 'name = "ITA_mechanized_vehicle_1_entity"' gfx/entities/
   ```

2. Search the vanilla install for the same name:

   ```bash
   grep -rn '"ITA_mechanized_vehicle_1_entity"' \
     ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Hearts\ of\ Iron\ IV/
   ```

3. If both return results, you have a duplicate.

**Fix options:**

- **Remove the mod definition** if the vanilla entity already provides the correct mesh and animations. Check that nothing else in the mod references the entity before deleting.
- **Rename the mod's entity** to a unique name (e.g., prefix with `TAG_MD_`) and update all references if the mod needs a different visual.

## Missing Clone Parent

```plaintext
[assetfactory.cpp:876]: Couldn't find parent clone entity JAP_MD4_infantry_1_entity,
  in file "gfx/entities/JAP_MD_infantryandvehicle.asset", near line 1808
```

This is usually followed by a second error:

```plaintext
[pdx_entity.cpp:324]: Failed to find entity "JAP_infantry_entity_desert" for attachment in infantry
```

**Cause:** A `clone = "..."` block references a parent entity that does not exist. The child entity fails to be created entirely, causing any downstream `attach` references to it to also fail.

**How to diagnose:**

Search for the parent entity name in all mod `.asset` files:

```bash
grep -rn 'name = "JAP_MD4_infantry_1_entity"' gfx/entities/
```

If no results, the parent was renamed, never defined, or is a typo.

**Fix:** Correct the `clone` value to point to an entity that actually exists. Check nearby entity blocks in the same file for the correct name:

```bash
grep -n 'name = "JAP_MD4_infantry' gfx/entities/JAP_MD_infantryandvehicle.asset
```

Example fix, change the nonexistent parent to the correct one:

```diff
 entity = {
-	clone = "JAP_MD4_infantry_1_entity"
+	clone = "JAP_MD4_infantry_2_entity"
 	name = "JAP_infantry_entity_desert"
 	pdxmesh = "JAP_MDinfantry1_mesh"
 }
```

## Duplicate Particle Name

```plaintext
[pdx_particle.cpp:1608]: Particle name is not unique: sparks_file
```

**Cause:** The mod defines a particle with the same `name` as a vanilla particle. Like entities, particle files are merged, not overridden.

**How to diagnose:**

1. Search mod particle files:

   ```bash
   grep -rn 'name="sparks_file"' gfx/particles/
   ```

2. Search vanilla:

   ```bash
   grep -rn 'name="sparks_file"' \
     ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Hearts\ of\ Iron\ IV/gfx/particles/
   ```

**Fix:** Rename the mod's particle to a unique name and update the corresponding `pdxparticle` reference in the `.gfx` file that references it.

`gfx/particles/vehicles/sparks.asset`:

```diff
 particle={
-	name="sparks_file"
+	name="MD_sparks_file"
```

`gfx/entities/MD_particles.gfx`:

```diff
 pdxparticle = {
 	name = "sparks_particle"
-	type = "sparks_file"
+	type = "MD_sparks_file"
 	scale = 1
 }
```

## Landmark Spawn Not Over Land

```plaintext
mapbuildings.cpp:679: map/buildings.txt error at line N: map building location is not over the land - ignoring instance.
```

**Cause:** A `landmark_spawn` line's `(x, z)` coordinates fall on a sea-province pixel. The trailing `province_id` field on the spawn line is just a binding hint, the engine still validates that the XZ pixel is on a land province via `map/provinces.bmp`.

**Common trigger:** copying a floating-harbor's coordinates as a starting point for a landmark spawn. Floating harbors sit in water, so their XZ is not a valid landmark position.

**How to diagnose:** read the bitmap directly to confirm which province the XZ lands in:

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np, csv

arr = np.array(Image.open('map/provinces.bmp')); H, W, _ = arr.shape
color_to_pid = {}
with open('map/definition.csv', encoding='latin-1') as f:
    for r in csv.reader(f, delimiter=';'):
        if r and r[0].isdigit():
            color_to_pid[(int(r[1]), int(r[2]), int(r[3]))] = int(r[0])

px, py = int(round(x)), (H-1) - int(round(z))
pid = color_to_pid.get(tuple(arr[py, px].tolist()))
print(f'XZ ({x},{z}) is in province {pid}')
```

If `pid` is a sea province (compare to `map/definition.csv` where the fifth column is `sea`), move the spawn to a land pixel. See [Add Landmarks](/dev-resources/add-landmarks/) for the full workflow including heightmap-calibrated `y`.

## Landmark Icon Shows but 3D Model Does Not Render

No error log entry, but the landmark icon appears in the state buildings panel and no 3D model is drawn on the map. Walk through this checklist:

1. `grep "^<state_id>;landmark_spawn" map/buildings.txt`: does a spawn line exist for the state at all? Map reworks have silently deleted spawn lines (commits `89ccbf62cc` and `4da960e3c8`); restore the deleted entry. Use `git log -S "<state_id>;landmark_spawn" -- map/buildings.txt` to confirm.
2. Confirm the spawn's `(x, z)` falls in the same province the state file places the landmark in (see the bitmap snippet above).
3. Check whether the placement province block in the state file shares with another building, particularly `naval_base = N`. Co-occupancy with naval_base blocks landmark rendering, split into separate province blocks.
4. Confirm the player has the DLC declared in the building's `dlc_allowed`.
5. Confirm MD's `gfx/entities/landmarks.asset` and `landmarks.gfx` contain the entity and mesh definitions. MD's copies of those files file-override vanilla, vanilla's entries for new landmarks are not merged in and must be copied across.

See [Add Landmarks](/dev-resources/add-landmarks/) for the full file-by-file mapping.

## Parent Window Not Found (GUI)

```plaintext
[p:447]: Parent window for MD_UN_SC_gui is not found.
```

**Cause:** A GUI element declares a `parent` container that hasn't been defined yet, or the parent name is misspelled.

**How to diagnose:**

```bash
grep -rn 'MD_UN_SC_gui\|name = "MD_UN_SC_gui"' interface/
```

Check that the parent `containerWindowType` or `windowType` exists and that its `name` matches exactly what is referenced.

---

## General Debugging Tips

- Always check the **vanilla DLC folders** as well as the base game, many entities and particles are added by DLC packs (e.g., `dlc025_axis_armor_pack`, `dlc048_expansion_pass_2_seaplane_tenders`).
- Entity names defined in mod files **cannot override** vanilla entities. You must use a unique name.
- After fixing an entity error, the downstream "Failed to find entity for attachment" errors for the same entity will automatically resolve.
- Filter the error log to just entity/asset lines for faster triage:

  ```bash
  grep -E 'pdx_entity|assetfactory|pdx_particle' error.log
  ```
