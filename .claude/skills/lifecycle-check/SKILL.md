description: 'Audit a country branch against the focus tree lifecycle checklist (focus tree, ideas, decisions, OOB, characters, loc, namelists, AI, game rules, graphics, changelog), reporting done/missing/partial per item. Use when asked if a country''s content is complete or review-ready, e.g. "/lifecycle-check UKR".'
---

Audit a country's content branch against the focus tree lifecycle checklist and report which phases are done or missing.

**Syntax:** `/lifecycle-check [TAG]`

- With `TAG`: check all required files for that specific country tag.
- Without argument: infer the TAG from the current branch name or changed files.

The authoritative checklist is `docs/src/content/resources/focus-tree-lifecycle-checklist.md`. Read it before starting.

## Execution

### 1. Determine the TAG

If TAG is provided, use it directly (uppercase). Otherwise run:

```
git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only
```

and infer the TAG from the most frequently changed country-specific prefix.

### 2. Check each lifecycle item

For each item mark **Done**, **Missing**, or **Partial** (file exists but seems incomplete, e.g. an empty stub).

#### Drafting Phase

Cannot be checked from files. Mark "not verifiable from code" and remind the user that draft approval must happen before coding.

| Item                    | How to check                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus tree file         | `common/national_focus/05_TAG.txt` exists and is non-empty             |
| Focus tree rewards      | Count `completion_reward` blocks vs focus count to spot stubs          |
| National ideas          | `common/ideas/TAG.txt` exists; grep for `idea` blocks                  |
| National decisions      | `common/decisions/TAG*.txt` (or under `categories/`) exists            |
| History file updated    | `history/countries/TAG*.txt` in branch diff, or exists and non-trivial |
| OOB file                | `history/units/TAG_*.txt` exists                                       |
| Character file          | `common/characters/TAG.txt` has a `general` or `field_marshal` block   |
| Party localisation      | `localisation/english/` contains a file with `TAG.` ideology keys      |
| Focus localisation      | `localisation/english/MD_focus_TAG_l_english.yml` non-empty            |
| Ideas localisation      | `localisation/english/` file with `TAG_idea_` or `TAG_spirit_` keys    |
| Decisions localisation  | `localisation/english/` contains a file with decision keys for TAG     |
| Unit namelists          | TAG name entries in `common/units/names/` or `names_divisions/`        |
| Investment/Influence AI | `common/ai_strategy/TAG*.txt` has investment or influence entries      |
| Game rules              | `common/game_rules/` contains a rule referencing TAG                   |
| Scripted localisation   | `common/scripted_localisation/` file with TAG entries (if used)        |

#### Graphics Phase

| Item             | How to check                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus icons      | Every focus has `icon =`; flag default/placeholder like `goal_unknown`    |
| Idea icons       | Grep the ideas file for `picture =`                                       |
| Leader portraits | `gfx/leaders/TAG/` directory exists and contains at least one `.dds` file |

#### Polish Phase

| Item                     | How to check                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Localisation spell-check | Cannot be checked automatically — note as "manual review needed" |
| error.log clear          | Cannot be checked from files — note as "requires in-game test"   |
| Playtest done            | Cannot be checked — note as "requires manual confirmation"       |
| Code Resource compliance | Note that `/content-review` and `/audit` should be run           |

#### Completion Phase

| Item            | How to check                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Changelog entry | Grep `Changelog.txt` for the TAG or country name                 |
| Authors updated | Grep `docs/src/content/misc/authors.md` for the developer's name |

- Authors updated cannot be verified automatically — note as "confirm manually".
