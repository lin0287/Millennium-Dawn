# Skills

Project slash commands for Claude Code. Each directory holds a `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter (`name`, `description`) is the source of truth — the session skill list is generated from it, so this table is a human-facing overview only.

Conventions: every skill has frontmatter with a trigger-quality `description`; `disable-model-invocation: true` marks skills that only run when the user invokes them (`/validate`, `/close-issue`, `/update-claude`). Reference material belongs in `.claude/docs/`, not in skill bodies — skills cite docs.
