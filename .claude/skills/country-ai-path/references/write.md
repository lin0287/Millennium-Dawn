# Write templates

Every artefact of a #3162 country pass, verbatim. Copy from here — **do not open another country's
focus tree to learn a shape**. Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria and Comoros are naming references only.

Substitute `DEN` / `Denmark` / the path names. Tabs for indentation.

## 1. Game rule — `common/game_rules/00_game_rules.txt`

```
DEN_ai_behavior = {
	name = "DEN_AI_BEHAVIOR"
	group = "RULE_GROUP_AI_BEHAVIOR"
	option = {
		name = HISTORICAL
		text = "RULE_OPTION_DEN_HISTORICAL"
		desc = "RULE_OPTION_DEN_HISTORICAL_DESC"
	}
	option = {
		name = EUROPEAN_UNION
		text = "RULE_OPTION_DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION"
		desc = "RULE_OPTION_DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION_DESC"
	}
	option = {
		name = RANDOM_PATH
		text = "RULE_OPTION_MD_RANDOM_PATH"
		desc = "RULE_OPTION_MD_RANDOM_PATH_DESC"
	}
	default = {
		name = NO_PATH
		text = "RULE_OPTION_MD_NO_PATH"
		desc = "RULE_OPTION_MD_NO_PATH_DESC"
	}
}
```

`NO_PATH` is the `default = { }` block and stays last — a fresh game leaves the AI unscripted unless
the player picks a path. `HISTORICAL` is a plain `option` and comes first, with one `option` per
alt-history path between it and `RANDOM_PATH`. No `DEFAULT`. Option names are unprefixed
(`EUROPEAN_UNION`, not `DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION`) and never contain "random". Don't reorder the file —
the alphabetical pass is a separate cross-cutting item.

## 2. Localisation — `localisation/english/MD_game_rules_l_english.yml`

The historical option's displayed text is literally `"Historical"`. Its `_desc` carries the
country-specific history. Never an evocative title, never `"Default"`, `"Historic"` or
`"Historical AI"` — those are pre-standard spellings still in the file.

```
 #Denmark
 DEN_AI_BEHAVIOR: "@DEN Denmark"
 RULE_OPTION_DEN_HISTORICAL: "Historical"
 RULE_OPTION_DEN_HISTORICAL_DESC: "..."
 RULE_OPTION_DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION: "Into the Union"
 RULE_OPTION_DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION_DESC: "..."
```

Header key `@TAG <short country name>` — `@EST Estonia`, not `@EST Republic of Estonia`. Some
countries carry it in `localisation/english/replace/replaced_from_game_rules_l_english.yml` instead;
check both before adding a duplicate. Some existing keys are suffixed `_MD` (`CZE_AI_BEHAVIOR_MD`) —
match whatever the rule's `name =` points at.

Every `_desc` is **exactly two sentences**, present tense about the country, no hard dates, `§8…§!`
on party and movement names. First sentence: what the country does. Second: what that means for the
world or its neighbours. Reference blocks: `TUR` and `BHR` in the same file.

`RANDOM_PATH` / `NO_PATH` reuse the shared keys that already exist near the top of the file —
`RULE_OPTION_MD_RANDOM_PATH`, `RULE_OPTION_MD_NO_PATH` and their `_DESC`s. Never write per-country
copies.

## 3. Flag wiring — `common/on_actions/999_game_rules_on_actions.txt`

```
				if = {
					limit = {
						has_game_rule = {
							rule = DEN_ai_behavior
							option = RANDOM_PATH
						}
					}
					random_list = {
						30 = { set_global_flag = DEN_HISTORICAL_FOCUS_PATH }
						15 = { set_global_flag = DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION_FOCUS_PATH }
						15 = { set_global_flag = DEN_EUROSCEPTIC_FOCUS_PATH }
						10 = { set_global_flag = DEN_NATIONALIST_FOCUS_PATH }
					}
				}
				if = {
					limit = {
						has_game_rule = {
							rule = DEN_ai_behavior
							option = HISTORICAL
						}
					}
					set_global_flag = DEN_HISTORICAL_FOCUS_PATH
				}
```

One `if` per named option. `RANDOM_PATH` draws from a `random_list` that **includes the historical
bucket** and excludes `NO_PATH`; no bucket may be empty. `NO_PATH` gets no branch at all — it sets
nothing. Flags are global (`set_global_flag`), never country flags.

Optional AI sentiment grant, if the country has one — `if`/`else_if`, no bookkeeping flag:

```
				if = {
					limit = {
						is_ai = yes
						has_global_flag = DEN_SOCIALIST_FOCUS_PATH
					}
					add_timed_idea = { idea = DEN_ai_communist_sentiment days = 1095 }
				}
				else_if = {
					limit = {
						is_ai = yes
						OR = {
							has_global_flag = DEN_MONARCHIST_FOCUS_PATH
							has_global_flag = DEN_NATIONALIST_FOCUS_PATH
						}
					}
					add_timed_idea = { idea = DEN_ai_nationalist_sentiment days = 1095 }
				}
```

Everything downstream gates on `has_global_flag`, **never** `has_game_rule` — including events and
strategy plans, or a `RANDOM_PATH` roll enables the flags but not the plan. Known direct readers to
convert when they touch your country: `HOL_strategy_plans.txt`, `events/Solomon_Islands.txt`,
`events/Sao_Tome_e_Principe.txt`, `events/comoros.txt`, `events/05_japan.txt`, `events/Italy.txt`,
`history/countries/GER - Germany.txt`, `common/scripted_effects/00_yearly_effects.txt`. The report's
Wiring section lists any remaining reader for your tag.

## 4. Scripted triggers — `common/scripted_triggers/99_DEN_scripted_triggers.txt`

Every ownership group gets an **owner** trigger and a **not** trigger. AI-internal, so no loc key and
no `custom_trigger_tooltip`.

The **historical** group is special and must use this owner trigger — the flag alone is not enough,
because under `NO_PATH` with historical AI on no flag is set and the historical spine would be
zeroed along with everything else:

```
DEN_ai_historical_path = {
	OR = {
		is_historical_focus_on = yes
		has_global_flag = DEN_HISTORICAL_FOCUS_PATH
	}
}

DEN_ai_not_historical_path = {
	OR = {
		has_global_flag = DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION_FOCUS_PATH
		has_global_flag = DEN_EUROSCEPTIC_FOCUS_PATH
		has_global_flag = DEN_SOCIALIST_FOCUS_PATH
		has_global_flag = DEN_NATIONALIST_FOCUS_PATH
	}
}
```

An **alt path** group owns its flag directly, and its not trigger carries the historical killswitch:

```
DEN_ai_not_socialist_path = {
	NOT = { has_global_flag = DEN_SOCIALIST_FOCUS_PATH }
	OR = {
		is_historical_focus_on = yes
		DEN_ai_rival_of_socialist_path = yes
	}
}
```

**Alias** — only when several flags own one spine. Substitute it for the flag on both lines
(`NOT = { DEN_ai_western_path = yes }` in the not trigger):

```
DEN_ai_western_path = {
	OR = {
		has_global_flag = DEN_HISTORICAL_FOCUS_PATH
		has_global_flag = DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION_FOCUS_PATH
	}
}
```

**Rival** — the paths that are not this one. Only worth defining when a not trigger would otherwise
repeat a long flag list, or when several groups share the same rival set:

```
DEN_ai_rival_of_socialist_path = {
	OR = {
		DEN_ai_western_path = yes
		has_global_flag = DEN_EUROSCEPTIC_FOCUS_PATH
		has_global_flag = DEN_NATIONALIST_FOCUS_PATH
	}
}
```

Triggers may call each other, so the set stays small. Keep the depth shallow — three levels is
plenty.

**The `is_historical_focus_on` arm is only safe inside `ai_will_do`.** Under an explicit alt rule with
historical AI on, the plain owner trigger above is _also_ true — harmless there only because the
mandated pair (§5) puts `factor = 0 DEN_ai_not_historical_path = yes` **last**, and that not trigger
is a pure alt-flag OR, so the killswitch wins. Two places break that guarantee:

- An **alias** spanning historical and an alt path. Its not trigger opens with
  `NOT = { DEN_ai_western_path = yes }`, so the alias being true suppresses its own killswitch and the
  historical spine outbids the rule the player picked.
- Any reader **outside** `ai_will_do` — a decision or category `visible`, a strategy-plan `enable`, a
  walker event `trigger`. There is no second modifier to correct it.

Either case needs the alt-flag guard (`99_FRA_scripted_triggers.txt:255`, `99_GEO_scripted_triggers.txt:43`):

```
DEN_ai_alt_path = {
	OR = {
		has_global_flag = DEN_EUROPEAN_UNION_FOCUS_PATH
		has_global_flag = DEN_EUROSCEPTIC_FOCUS_PATH
		has_global_flag = DEN_SOCIALIST_FOCUS_PATH
		has_global_flag = DEN_NATIONALIST_FOCUS_PATH
	}
}

DEN_ai_historical_path = {
	OR = {
		has_global_flag = DEN_HISTORICAL_FOCUS_PATH
		AND = {
			is_historical_focus_on = yes
			NOT = { DEN_ai_alt_path = yes }
		}
	}
}
```

Name the helper `TAG_ai_alt_path` for the non-historical flags and `TAG_ai_any_path` when it must
include historical too (`99_EGY_scripted_triggers.txt:18`, `99_IRQ_scripted_triggers.txt:8`). A single
reader outside `ai_will_do` may instead pair the plain trigger with its not trigger —
`DEN_ai_historical_path = yes` + `DEN_ai_not_historical_path = no` (§8, `ITA_strategy_plans.txt:6`).

`ai_path_report.py` reports both failures: a focus alive under an alt rule only because historical is
on, and a decision gate that is dead under `NO_PATH` or visible during an alt path.

**Precondition.** The collapsed shape is behaviour-identical to the old three-modifier form only
while at most one `TAG_*_FOCUS_PATH` flag is ever set and each not trigger excludes its own group's
flags. The report's Wiring section checks both; read it before writing the triggers.

## 5. Focus weights — `common/national_focus/05_denmark.txt`

The only shape — one boost, one killswitch. Historical group:

```
		ai_will_do = {
			base = 1
			modifier = { factor = 25 DEN_ai_historical_path = yes }
			modifier = { factor = 0 DEN_ai_not_historical_path = yes }
		}
```

Alt path group (owner is the flag, or an alias where a spine is shared):

```
		ai_will_do = {
			base = 1
			modifier = { factor = 25 has_global_flag = DEN_SOCIALIST_FOCUS_PATH }
			modifier = { factor = 0 DEN_ai_not_socialist_path = yes }
		}
```

Path modifiers are always **multiplicative** (`factor`), never `add` — an `add` loses to any
multiplicative historical modifier, which is the default state. Situational `add` nudges unrelated
to paths are fine and stay.

The two path modifiers go **last in the block**, after every other modifier. Order matters:
modifiers apply in sequence, so an `add` after a `factor = 0` resurrects a focus the killswitch was
meant to kill. Everything else in the block (bankruptcy, `can_staff`, `ai_is_threatened`, crisis
weighting) keeps its place and form — never fold a guard into a path trigger, or
`validate_focus_tree.py` stops recognising it.

Don't write these by hand. Author the mapping and run:

```bash
python tools/standardization/apply_ai_path_weights.py --tag DEN --map <file or ->
```

Mapping format — one `group` line per ownership group, an optional `boost` default, then one line
per focus. `owner=` names a scripted trigger, `owner_flag=` a global flag; a trailing number
overrides the default boost; `-` un-owns a focus (strips its path modifiers, keeps everything else):

```
group historical owner=DEN_ai_historical_path not=DEN_ai_not_historical_path
group socialist owner_flag=DEN_SOCIALIST_FOCUS_PATH not=DEN_ai_not_socialist_path
boost 25

DEN_join_the_euro      historical
DEN_red_bloc           socialist 150
DEN_army_reform        -
```

`--dry-run` lists every modifier the run would remove without writing. The tool refuses unknown or
duplicated focus ids, shared focus files, and any rewrite that would not be idempotent.

Leave the economy, army, airforce and equipment trunk path-neutral — only re-own focuses that
actually belong to a path.

## 6. AI-only popularity ramp — decisions

Needed when the chosen path's party cannot reach power on its own. Category in
`common/decisions/categories/99_DEN_decision_categories.txt`:

```
DEN_ai_path_category = {
	allowed = {
		is_ai = yes
		original_tag = DEN
	}

	icon = GFX_decisions_category_political
	priority = 100

	visible = {
		OR = {
			has_global_flag = DEN_MONARCHIST_FOCUS_PATH
			has_global_flag = DEN_NATIONALIST_FOCUS_PATH
		}
	}
}
```

The icon must be a **category** sprite (52x40, `GFX_decisions_category_*`), not a decision one.

Raw flags are right only while every path in the `visible` is an **alt** path, as above. A ramp that
also has to run for the **historical** party gates on the alt-guarded `DEN_ai_historical_path` (§4)
instead — raw `DEN_HISTORICAL_FOCUS_PATH` is dead under `NO_PATH` with historical AI, which is the one
state the trigger exists to cover, and a bare unguarded trigger runs the historical ramp on top of the
alt ramp the player picked. Both mistakes are live today: `GER_ai_path_category` and
`GRE_ai_path_category` read the raw flag; `EGY_ai_rally_the_generals` and `IND_rally_the_awakening`
read the unguarded trigger.

A ramp pair per path, in `common/decisions/<Country>.txt`:

```
	DEN_rally_the_monarchists = {

		icon = generic_decision

		cost = 25

		days_re_enable = 30

		visible = { has_global_flag = DEN_MONARCHIST_FOCUS_PATH }

		available = {
			has_civil_war = no
			check_variable = { party_pop_array^23 < 0.55 }
		}

		complete_effect = {
			log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Decision DEN_rally_the_monarchists"
			set_temp_variable = { party_index = 23 }
			set_temp_variable = { party_popularity_increase = 0.04 }
			set_temp_variable = { temp_outlook_increase = 0.04 }
			change_relative_party_popularity = yes
		}

		ai_will_do = { base = 100 }
	}

	DEN_monarchists_take_the_country = {

		icon = generic_decision

		cost = 150

		days_re_enable = 180

		visible = { has_global_flag = DEN_MONARCHIST_FOCUS_PATH }

		available = {
			has_civil_war = no
			nationalist_monarchists_are_in_power = no
			check_variable = { party_pop_array^23 > 0.5 }
		}

		complete_effect = {
			log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Decision DEN_monarchists_take_the_country"
			set_temp_variable = { rul_party_temp = 23 }
			change_ruling_party_effect = yes
		}

		ai_will_do = { base = 100 }
	}
```

The category is `is_ai = yes`, so **no localisation keys at all** — not for the category, not for a
decision name or desc — and bare `check_variable` in `available` with no
`custom_trigger_tooltip`. `validate_decisions.py` reports added keys as
`ai-only-decision-localisation`.

Read `change_relative_party_popularity` before picking numbers: passing `temp_outlook_increase`
skips the sibling-redistribution loop, so it is required when the target group starts at zero and
wrong when the target sits inside a group next to the incumbent.

## 7. AI strategy — war weighting

`declare_war` is target-keyed (`id = TAG`) and weights only **opening** a war. There is no
`dont_declare_war` token and no targetless form. A `declare_war` block gated on
`has_war_with = TARGET` is a no-op. The 306 `TAG_cancel_war_TARGET` blocks across
ITA/LIC/TUR/JAP/GER/HOL/ENG/SWE/CHI/BUL/CUB/IND/CAN/VEN/COL/ETH/GUY/KOR are that bug — never copy
one, never add one.

**Surrender brake, per target** (`common/ai_strategy/ALG.txt` is the model):

```
DEN_cancel_war_neighbours = {
	allowed = { original_tag = DEN }
	enable = {
		has_war = yes
		surrender_progress > 0.15
	}
	abort_when_not_enabled = yes

	ai_strategy = { type = declare_war id = "SWE" value = -4000 }
	ai_strategy = { type = declare_war id = "GER" value = -4000 }
}
```

**Pre-war readiness gate, per target.** Enable on `has_wargoal_against = X` +
`NOT = { has_war_with = X }` + a strength or size check, then `declare_war id = X` negative to hold
and positive to release. `MD_war_declaration_ai.txt`, `BOS_avoid_unready_war_with_cro` /
`BOS_prepare_war_with_cro` are the references. Cache anything containing `any_of_scopes` behind a
country flag and have `enable` read only the flag.

**Losing-war brake, targetless.** `avoid_starting_wars` gated on `has_war = yes` +
`enemies_strength_ratio`; `SOV_avoid_starting_wars`, `BLR_avoid_starting_wars` and `RAJ.txt:378` are
the references. `enemies_strength_ratio` rises as your enemies get stronger (MD's peace-deal
triggers read `> 1.7` as losing, `> 2.0` as massively outgunned), while
`strength_ratio = { tag = X ratio < 1 }` means you are weaker than X. `avoid_starting_wars` is
additive with `conquer`, not a standalone peacefulness dial — read the surrounding `conquer` values
before picking a sign or magnitude. A per-tag `avoid_starting_wars` stricter than the mod-wide
`MD_avoid_new_wars_when_outmatched` (`enemies_strength_ratio > 0.75`) is a strict subset and can
never fire.

**Never** add an `on_daily_<TAG>` pass that caches booleans into country flags for `enable` or
`ai_will_do` to read. Both are already evaluated lazily; a daily cache costs more and lags real
state by a day. Write the condition inline.

## 8. Historical government walker — `events/<country>.txt`

Only when the report's `government` section verdicts **dated timeline**. On an undated successor
roster, write nothing: the ramp decisions in §6 already deliver the party, and a walker over an
undated roster installs the wrong person.

The path rule steers the party; nothing steers the person. `set_leader` runs on a re-election only
behind a term limit (`events/MD_Elections.txt:2277`, `:2355`) and only 95 of 393 history files set
one, so a country whose party keeps winning never rotates its leader and no intra-party succession
can happen. The walker is the fix: an AI-only hidden event fired at the real historical dates, which
asserts the ruling party and the roster pointer and lets the existing succession list supply the
name.

```
country_event = {
	id = denmark_md.400
	hidden = yes
	is_triggered_only = yes

	trigger = {
		is_ai = yes
		has_civil_war = no
		DEN_ai_historical_path = yes
		DEN_ai_not_historical_path = no
		NOT = { has_country_flag = generic_election_killswitch }
	}

	immediate = {
		log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: event denmark_md.400"
		if = {
			limit = { date > 2022.10.24 }
			set_variable = { conservatism_leader = 6 }
			set_temp_variable = { rul_party_temp = 1 }
		}
		else_if = {
			limit = { date > 2019.7.23 }
			set_variable = { socialism_leader = 1 }
			set_temp_variable = { rul_party_temp = 3 }
		}
		else = {
			set_variable = { socialism_leader = 0 }
			set_temp_variable = { rul_party_temp = 3 }
		}

		if = {
			limit = { NOT = { is_in_array = { ruling_party = rul_party_temp } } }
			change_ruling_party_effect = yes
			set_elections_60_months = yes
		}
		else = {
			set_leader = yes
		}
	}
}
```

Scheduled once per historical date from `common/scripted_effects/00_yearly_effects.txt`, inside the
matching `trigger_year_<Y>_events` block. The dispatcher runs at the January tick and MD's day counts
ignore leap years:

```
DEN = { country_event = { id = denmark_md.400 days = 158 } }
```

**Pointer semantics.** `<subideology>_leader = N` means _the next person created is roster index N_.
Each roster block in `common/scripted_effects/<TAG>_political_leaders.txt` increments before creating,
and the blocks are sequential `if`s rather than `else_if`s, so the cascade keeps running past N until
a block's `date <` end-of-tenure guard sets `b = 1`. The last entry of every branch sets `b`
unconditionally, so the list never falls off its end.

**Assert the index in every branch.** Never blind-advance by calling `set_leader` and trusting the
pointer. Explicit assertion makes each date idempotent and self-repairing: a generic election between
two historical dates moves the pointer, and the next date snaps it back. `britain_md.400` and
`HOL_politics.86` blind-advance, which is why the AI UK gets Gordon Brown in 2005 and Ed Miliband in 2007.

**Never pass `change_leader_temp = 1`.** It sets `do_not_retire`
(`common/scripted_effects/00_MD_politicsview_scripted_effects.txt:2231`), which makes the roster
cascade pin at the current pointer instead of fast-forwarding. `britain_md.400` does this on its 2015
party change and installs William Hague — a leader whose tenure ended in 2001 — as Prime Minister.
Use it only to deliberately keep an incumbent across a coalition reshuffle.

**Bound the date chain.** One descending `if`/`else_if` where every branch asserts both the party and
the roster index, then one shared tail that decides change-vs-advance. The chain's final `else` must
not change the ruling party on its own: with no upper bound, a re-fire after the last historical date
reinstalls the earliest government.

**`set_elections_XX_months` on a party change only** (`:2619` / `:2626` / `:2633`), matching the
country's `election_frequency`. It resyncs `last_election` so the generic clock does not fire weeks
later and undo the forced government. Calling it on every branch suppresses AI election news
indefinitely.

**Never inline `create_country_leader`.** `ast_elections.1` (`events/05_australia_events.txt:4894`)
does; it duplicates the leader data, leaves the person missing from the roster, and desyncs the
pointer for every other caller of `set_leader`. If the historical person is absent, append an entry to
`<TAG>_political_leaders.txt` in that file's exact existing shape, with a real end-of-tenure `date <`
marker and a `picture =` that exists under `gfx/leaders/<TAG>/` — nothing validates leader portraits,
and the filename is case-sensitive on Linux.

The event is hidden and `is_ai = yes`, so it gets **no localisation keys at all**. Gate on the §4
scripted triggers, never on raw flags: countries converted before this standard carry older flag names
(ENG reads `ENG_HISTORICAL_AI_FOCUS`, not `_FOCUS_PATH`). Between two historical dates the generic
election machinery still runs and may seat someone else; the next date re-asserts. That is the
accepted fidelity ceiling.
