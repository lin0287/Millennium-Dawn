# Decision Reference

Decision conventions, structure, and examples. Use `ai_will_do = { base = N }`,
not root-level `factor`, for AI weights.

## Icon Field

The decision `icon = X` field accepts **either** the bare sprite stem **or** the fully-qualified `GFX_decision_` name — the engine auto-prepends `GFX_decision_` when resolving a bare name. Both render identically:

```
icon = generic_political_discourse              # resolves to GFX_decision_generic_political_discourse
icon = GFX_decision_generic_political_discourse # explicit, same result
```

The bare form is the dominant convention in this codebase (e.g. `generic_decision`, `political_actions`, `generic_nationalism`). **Do not "fix" a bare decision icon by adding the `GFX_decision_` prefix — it is not broken.** Only flag an icon when neither `GFX_decision_<name>` nor `GFX_<name>` exists in any `interface/*.gfx` file. (Decision **category** icons and most other contexts still require the explicit `GFX_` sprite name — this auto-prefix shortcut is specific to the decision `icon` field.)

## Targeted Decisions

A decision becomes targeted when it includes `targets`, `target_array`, `target_trigger`, or `target_root_trigger`. The decision clones itself for each valid target. `ROOT` is the country taking the decision; `FROM` is the target.

### Trigger Evaluation Order & Frequency

| Block                 | Scope       | Frequency              | Purpose                        |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `allowed`             | ROOT        | Once (game start/load) | Permanent gate                 |
| `target_root_trigger` | ROOT only   | Daily                  | Fast pre-filter                |
| `target_trigger`      | ROOT + FROM | Daily                  | Per-target daily filter        |
| `visible`             | ROOT + FROM | Every tick             | UI visibility (most expensive) |
| `available`           | ROOT + FROM | Every tick             | Clickability gate              |

`target_trigger` runs only if `target_root_trigger` passes — a false pre-filter skips all targets.

**Don't repeat the category's `allowed` on each decision.** A decision's `allowed` is redundant when it just duplicates the parent category's `allowed` (e.g. both are `original_tag = TAG`) — the category gate already applies to every decision inside it. Restrict the nation once on the category; put dynamic conditions in `available`/`visible` (since `allowed` is locked at game start).

### Performance Optimization

**Always move ROOT-only conditions from `visible` to `target_root_trigger`.** Single most impactful decision optimization:

- `visible` runs every tick, for every target — O(ticks × targets)
- `target_root_trigger` runs once daily, ROOT only — O(1/day)

When `target_root_trigger` is false, the engine skips `target_trigger`, `visible`, and `available` entirely for all targets.

**Rules:**

- Conditions that only check ROOT (flags, focuses, ideas, original_tag) belong in `target_root_trigger`
- Conditions that reference `FROM` must stay in `target_trigger` or `visible`
- Dynamic flags like `has_country_flag = flag_@FROM` reference FROM to build the name — these need `target_trigger` (not `target_root_trigger`)
- `hidden_trigger` is redundant inside `target_root_trigger` — it never generates tooltips
- `always = yes` inside `target_root_trigger` is a no-op — remove it
- Never restate what the target list already guarantees: with an explicit `targets = { ... }`, `NOT = { tag = ROOT }` and `NOT = { original_tag = X }` for a tag outside the list are dead conditions evaluated once per target per day

### Target Selection

```
targets = { TAG TAG ... }        # Explicit list of country tags
target_array = array_name        # Array on ROOT scope
target_array = global.array_name # Global array
targets_dynamic = yes            # Include civil war tags
target_non_existing = yes        # Include non-existing countries
state_target = yes               # Target states instead of countries
```

### Targeted Decision Example

```
my_targeted_decision = {
 target_root_trigger = {
  has_completed_focus = my_focus
 }
 targets = { BHR QAT SAU OMA YEM IRQ SYR LEB ISR PAL }
 targets_dynamic = yes
 target_trigger = {
  FROM = { has_idea = my_idea }
 }
 icon = my_icon
 cost = 20
 war_with_target_on_complete = yes
 complete_effect = {
  create_wargoal = {
   target = FROM
   type = annex_everything
  }
 }
}
```

### State-Targeted Decision Example

```
my_state_targeted_decision = {
 state_target = yes
 target_root_trigger = {
  has_completed_focus = my_focus
 }
 target_array = GER.core_states
 target_trigger = {
  FROM = { is_owned_by = ROOT }
 }
 on_map_mode = map_and_decisions_view
 icon = my_icon
 cost = 20
 complete_effect = {
  FROM = { remove_core_of = GER }
 }
}
```

### War with Target

Regular `war_with_on_*` does not work with FROM. Use these instead:

- `war_with_target_on_complete = yes`
- `war_with_target_on_remove = yes`
- `war_with_target_on_timeout = yes`

## Effect Block Logging

The engine runs four blocks as a decision's effects: `complete_effect` (player takes it), `remove_effect` (`days_remove` timer expires or `remove_trigger` fires), `timeout_effect` (mission `days_mission_timeout` expires) and `cancel_effect` (`cancel_trigger` fires). Each one logs its own line, as the block's first statement:

```
 log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Decision DECISION_ID"
```

Log first so the game log reads in firing order, and use the decision's own ID: a copied ID from a neighbouring decision is the most common mistake here (`tools/linting/fix_log_ids.py` rewrites those). A log nested inside an `if` / `else` / `hidden_effect` records which branch ran, so it belongs where it sits and does not substitute for the block's own log line.

`validate_decisions.py` reports a block with no log as `missing-decision-log` and a block-level log that is not first as `decision-log-not-first`. A log that is the _only_ content of a `complete_effect` is a separate mistake: `check_common_mistakes.py` rejects it, because the block does nothing but log. Delete the dead block instead.

## AI-Only Decisions

A decision is **AI-only** when the engine can never show it to a human player. Two forms count:

- an unconditional `is_ai = yes` at the top level of the decision's own `visible`, `available` or `allowed` block, or
- membership in a decision **category** whose `visible` / `available` / `allowed` carries that same unconditional `is_ai = yes`.

```
 SOV_nuke_europe = {
  allowed = { original_tag = SOV }

  visible = {
   is_ai = yes
  }
```

"Unconditional" means the token sits at brace depth zero of the trigger block. Nested inside `OR`, `AND`, `if = { limit = }` or a scoped `TAG = { }` it is conditional and the decision is **not** AI-only — `allowed = { OR = { is_ai = yes  is_debug = yes } }` still shows to a player in debug, and `GRE = { is_ai = yes }` asks about a different country entirely.

**An AI-only decision takes no localisation.** Nothing renders its name or tooltip, so a key for it is dead weight that later has to be translated. The raw ID surfacing in the decision UI is harmless because no human ever opens that tab. `validate_decisions.py` enforces both directions: an AI-only decision is exempt from `missing-decision-localisation`, and a key that does exist for one is reported as `ai-only-decision-localisation`. Both are WARNING-severity. `custom_cost_text` is exempt from the reverse check, since it can point at a scripted-loc key shared with player-facing decisions.

The same holds for an **AI-only category** — one whose own `visible` / `available` / `allowed` carries that unconditional `is_ai = yes`. Its header is drawn in the same tab as its decisions, so its `<id>` and `<id>_desc` are dead weight too and are reported under `ai-only-decision-localisation` as well. The one exemption is a category named by `unlock_decision_category_tooltip` in a focus or decision, which renders the name key outside that tab. Categories are still never _required_ to carry localisation — the missing-key direction does not apply to them.

**An AI-only decision takes no tooltip wrappers either.** `custom_trigger_tooltip` exists to give a requirement line a human can read, and `custom_effect_tooltip` to describe an effect the player is about to trigger; on an AI-only decision both render to nobody and only keep a loc key alive. Write the trigger bare:

```
  available = {
   nationalist_monarchists_are_in_power = no
   check_variable = { party_pop_array^23 < 0.35 }
  }
```

`validate_variables.py` backs this: its three `available`-block checks — `untooltipped-available-check`, `unlocalised-available-flag` and `untooltipped-available-scripted-trigger` — skip AI-only decisions and every decision inside an AI-only category, using the same depth-0 `is_ai = yes` rule as above.

## Announcing a Category

A category with no `visible` block sits on the decisions tab from the first day, and one gated only on the tag or the date is on from the start too. Neither has anything to announce.

A category gated on state that flips during play (a country or global flag, a completed focus, an idea, a variable) appears part-way through a game. Whatever turns it on should say so, with `unlock_decision_category_tooltip = <category>` in the focus `completion_reward` or event effect that sets the gate:

```
 completion_reward = {
  set_country_flag = ALG_drone_program_open
  unlock_decision_category_tooltip = ALG_drone_program_category
 }
```

Without it a whole tab of decisions appears with no indication of where it came from. `unlock_decision_tooltip = <decision>` on one of its decisions counts too, since that names the decision the player just gained.

`validate_decisions.py` reports the gap as `unannounced-decision-category` (WARNING), naming the trigger that makes the category conditional so the fix location is obvious. AI-only categories are exempt: nobody is watching.

The check is **opt-in** (`--unannounced-categories`) and does not run in CI. MD has 118 categories in this state, so it is a backlog to work through deliberately rather than a gate on new work.

The gate must sit at brace depth zero of `visible` to count. Inside a `NOT` the meaning inverts: `NOT = { has_country_flag = X }` is satisfied _until_ X is set, so X hides the category rather than opening it.

## Announcing a Decision

A decision effect that sets a flag another decision's `visible` or `available` waits on has unlocked that decision. `unlock_decision_tooltip = <decision>` is how the player is told:

```
  complete_effect = {
   set_country_flag = SAU_decisive_storm
   unlock_decision_tooltip = SAU_storm_air_campaign
  }
```

MD does not announce every unlock, so `validate_decisions.py` only reports the inconsistent case as `unannounced-decision-unlock` (WARNING): a block that already calls `unlock_decision_tooltip` at least once and misses a sibling gated on the very flag it just set. That is an oversight, not a style choice. Both `visible` and `available` gates count, and the same depth-zero rule applies.

## Randomised Effects

A decision that can fire more than once and rolls randomness (`random_list = { ... }` or `random = { chance = N ... }`) needs `fixed_random_seed = no` at decision top level:

```
 days_re_enable = 180

 fixed_random_seed = no

 remove_effect = {
```

The engine seeds the roll from the save state, so without it every repeat of the decision returns the same branch. `fire_only_once = yes` decisions are exempt, since their roll only ever resolves once. Write `fixed_random_seed = yes` when the repeat _should_ be deterministic; `validate_decisions.py` treats an explicit value either way as intentional and only flags the field being absent.

## Formable Commitment Ratchet

The AI commits to one formable at a time via `formable_committed_id` / `formable_committed_size`; every decision in `common/decisions/formable_nation_decisions.txt` carries an AI-only `ai_will_do` gate that blocks any formable other than the committed one unless it is strictly larger, and special formables (USoE, EFS membership, UAR, ...) commit through `commit_special_formable` with a sentinel size that outranks every decision formable. Full contract, id/size tables, guarded sites, and the maintenance rules (a new formable must wire the gates; editing an `update_flag` state list means updating every size literal — `validate_decisions.py` gates on drift): [formable-reference.md](formable-reference.md).

Every decision in `common/decisions/formable_nation_decisions.txt` carries an AI-only `ai_will_do` gate — _blocked when committed to a different formable that is not strictly smaller_:

```
 modifier = {
  factor = 0
  NOT = { check_variable = { formable_committed_id = <ID> } }
  check_variable = {
   var = formable_committed_size
   value = <SIZE>
   compare = greater_than_or_equals
  }
 }
```

Commit writes (`hidden_effect` setting both variables) live in every `integrate_start` and `update_flag` `complete_effect`; IBR/ANZ (which have no `integrate_start`) commit from their integrate decisions' `remove_effect`, and Spain's `SPR_solidify_the_iberian_union` focus commits IBR — those delayed/ungated sites guard the write with `compare = less_than` so they never downgrade a larger commitment. NORDEM/AVG/ANZ gates carry an extra exemption so a CANZUK commitment stranded by the EU guard cannot block its fallback formables, and `CANZUK_integrate_start` is AI-blocked while EU-blocked.

A **new formable** must wire all of this: gate on every decision, commit in `integrate_start`/`update_flag`, a fresh unique id, and size = its `update_flag` state-list count. **Editing an `update_flag` state list requires updating that formable's size literal at every gate/commit site.** `validate_decisions.py` (`validate_formable_commitment_sync`) recomputes the counts and gates on any drift, missing gate, or id collision — including the Spain focus literals.

## Example: Basic Decision

```
URA_world_opr = {
 allowed = { original_tag = URA }
 icon = GFX_decision_sovfed_button

 cost = 50
 days_remove = 400

 visible = {
  country_exists = OPR
  OPR = {
   OR = {
    has_autonomy_state = autonomy_republic_rf
    has_autonomy_state = autonomy_kray_rf
   }
  }
 }

 complete_effect = {
  log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Decision URA_world_opr"
  OPR = { country_event = { id = subject_rus.121 days = 1 } }
 }

 ai_will_do = { base = 10 }
}
```

## Example: Mission with Timeout (if/else Pattern)

Missions use `activation` instead of player selection, with `days_mission_timeout` and `timeout_effect`:

```
ISR_pal_rooting_terrorists = {
 available = { always = no }
 activation = {
  has_country_flag = ISR_start_operation
 }
 days_mission_timeout = 60
 is_good = no
 icon = GFX_decision_category_taliban_insurgency

 visible = {
  has_country_flag = ISR_start_operation
 }
 cancel_if_not_visible = yes

 timeout_effect = {
  log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Decision ISR_pal_rooting_terrorists"
  custom_effect_tooltip = ISR_operation_result_outcome_tt
  custom_effect_tooltip = ISR_operation_failed_root_terr_tt
  hidden_effect = {
   clr_country_flag = ISR_start_operation
   if = {
    limit = {
     check_variable = { ISR_operation_success > 7 }
    }
    ISR = { country_event = israel.91 }
    PAL = { country_event = israel.91 }
   }
   else = {
    ISR = { country_event = israel.92 }
    PAL = { country_event = israel.92 }
   }
  }
 }
}
```

## Economic Scripted Effects

Commonly used in decision effects:

### Government Spending Laws

```
# Bureaucracy
increase_centralization = yes / decrease_centralization = yes

# Social Spending
increase_social_spending = yes / decrease_social_spending = yes

# Education
increase_education_budget = yes / decrease_education_budget = yes

# Healthcare
increase_healthcare_budget = yes / decrease_healthcare_budget = yes

# Policing
increase_policing_budget = yes / decrease_policing_budget = yes

# Trade Law
increase_exports = yes / decrease_exports = yes

# Military Spending
increase_military_spending = yes / decrease_military_spending = yes
```

### Political Effects

```
# Party popularity — defaults to the ruling party when party_index is unset
set_temp_variable = { party_popularity_increase = 0.10 }
change_relative_party_popularity = yes

# Or target a specific party by index (0-23)
set_temp_variable = { party_index = 2 }
set_temp_variable = { party_popularity_increase = 0.10 }
change_relative_party_popularity = yes

# Ban/unban party
set_temp_variable = { party_index = 1 }
ban_party_scripted_call = yes
unban_party_scripted_call = yes
```

### Influence Effects

```
# Domestic influence
set_temp_variable = { percent_change = 10 }
change_domestic_influence_percentage = yes

# Foreign influence (requires target; tag_index defaults to ROOT.id)
set_temp_variable = { percent_change = 5 }
set_temp_variable = { influence_target = GER }
change_influence_percentage = yes
```
