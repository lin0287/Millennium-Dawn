# HOI4 Data Structures — Full Reference

For full lists of effects, triggers, modifiers, and dynamic variables, see the corresponding files in `resources/documentation/`.

## Scopes and Identity

`ROOT` is the original scope, `FROM` the event sender, and `PREV` the previous scope
(`PREV.PREV` chains). `OWNER` and `CAPITAL` select the state's owner and country's
capital. `CONTROLLER` is state-scope only. Event dispatch can change what `FROM`
means; see [Effect Scope Interpolation](scripting-edge-cases.md#effect-scope-interpolation).

`tag` is the runtime tag; civil-war countries get a new one. `original_tag` retains
national identity. Use `original_tag` for nation-restricted objects such as MIOs and
slotted ideas; use `tag` only when the literal current tag matters. Unslotted ideas
have separate rules in [Idea Reference](idea-reference.md).

## State and Naming

- Prefix country-specific variables and flags with `TAG_`, globals with `GLOBAL_`,
  and shared-system state with its domain prefix. Use `snake_case` after the prefix;
  keep system acronyms uppercase.
- Query existing ideas, focus completion, ideology, subjects, factions, variables,
  or event targets instead of adding a flag that mirrors them. A flag is appropriate
  for otherwise unavailable state or a historical transition.
- Unset numeric variables read as zero. Do not seed them to zero at startup, including
  dynamic-modifier backing variables. Resetting a used variable to zero is different.
- Keep array slot indices distinct from type IDs. See
  [Array Index Semantics](scripting-edge-cases.md#array-index-semantics).

## Variable Types

### Persistent variables

Stored on a scope (country, state, unit leader). Survive saves.

```
SOV = { set_variable = { var = my_var value = 5 } }
SOV.my_var         # read from another scope
```

### Temporary variables

Exist only for the current scripted block. Prefixed with `temp_` in effects but accessed by name.

```
set_temp_variable = { var = my_temp value = 10 }
```

### Global variables

Stored globally, not on any scope.

```
set_global_variable = { var = global_my_var value = 1 }
global.global_my_var   # read globally
```

### Array elements

Accessed via `^` subscript (zero-indexed). Arrays cap at **1000 elements** — `add_to_array` beyond index 999 silently does nothing.

```
my_array^0       # first element
my_array^3       # fourth element
my_array^i       # element at index i (dynamic index from a loop variable)
```

## Variable Access Syntax

```
my_var                          # local variable on current scope
ROOT.my_var                     # variable on ROOT scope
GER.my_var                      # variable on specific country
my_array^0                      # array element by literal index
my_array^i                      # array element by dynamic loop index
var:my_var = { ... }            # scope into the country/state stored in my_var
var:my_array^i = { ... }        # scope into the country stored at array[i]  ← CORRECT
var:v = { ... }                 # scope into the country stored in loop value v ← CORRECT
var:v^i = { ... }               # WRONG — v is a scalar value, not an array
```

**Key rule:** `value = v` in a loop stores the **scalar element** (e.g. a country tag number) into `v`. It is NOT an array reference. To scope into the country at position `i`, use either `var:v = { ... }` (v holds the country reference) or `var:ARRAYNAME^i = { ... }` (explicit array name + dynamic index). Never `var:v^i` — `v` is a scalar and `^i` does not apply.

## Variable & Array Effects

All use `{ var = X value = Y }` syntax. All have `_temp_` equivalents (e.g. `add_to_temp_variable`).

**Variables:** `set_variable`, `add_to_variable`, `subtract_from_variable`, `multiply_variable`, `divide_variable`, `modulo_variable`, `round_variable`, `clamp_variable` (min/max), `set_variable_to_random`

**Arrays:** `add_to_array`, `remove_from_array` (by value or index), `clear_array`, `resize_array`, `find_highest_in_array`, `find_lowest_in_array`, `random_scope_in_array`

Short forms: `add_to_array = { my_array = 42 }`, `remove_from_array = { my_array = 42 }`, `is_in_array = { my_array = 42 }`

## Math Expressions

**Preferred over scratch temp variables for pure arithmetic.** An inline calculator that reads constants, scoped variables, and dynamic game variables, then applies a sequence of operations. Supported as the value argument of every variable/temp-variable effect **except** `modulo_variable` and `clamp_variable`.

**Default to a math expression instead of a chain of `set_temp_variable` + `add_to_variable` + `multiply_variable` whenever the goal is a calculated value.** One expression replaces several temp-var writes, and the engine evaluates it in a single pass — it is the more performance-friendly form, not just the shorter one. The win compounds with frequency: the hotter the path (per-tick GUI, daily on_action, AI evaluation), the more a math expression saves over scratch temp variables. Reach for temp variables only when you need to reuse an intermediate result across several later effects, or when an operation the expression syntax doesn't support (`modulo_variable`, `clamp_variable`) is involved.

### Syntax

The math expression is the **value** of the effect. Wrap it in `{ ... }` so the parser can tell where the expression ends and the effect's own keywords begin. The expression is a base `value = ...` followed by sequential statements that mutate an accumulator. Each statement is one of:

- **No-argument** — applies an operation to the accumulator: `round = yes`.
- **Simple** — takes one or more sub-expressions: `add = 5`, `clamp = { min = 0 max = 100 }`.
- **Control flow** — takes a block: `if = { limit = { ... } add = 100 } else = { subtract = 1 }`.
- **Collection iterator** — scopes to each element of a named collection and applies statements: `every_collection = { ... }`.

The full statement list, with per-statement examples, is in `resources/documentation/script_math_functions.md`.

**`set_variable` / `set_temp_variable`**, two equivalent shapes:

```
# Long form: var name as the key, math expression as its value
set_temp_variable = {
    foo = {
        value = bar
        multiply = 2
        add = baz
    }
}
```

```
# Short form: var = X plus value = { ... }
set_temp_variable = {
    var = foo
    value = {
        value = bar
        multiply = 2
        add = baz
    }
}
```

Both compile to the same result. The long form is one block shallower (no `var =` line). The short form reads more like the accumulate shape below and is the one to reach for when a tool or surrounding context expects `var =` to be explicit.

**Do not write the math expression as siblings of `var = X`.** That form silently parses to 0.0 (no error, no log) and is the most common cause of "my `set_temp_variable` is mysteriously producing 0" reports:

```
# WRONG, silently evaluates to 0.0
set_variable = {
    var = combined_units
    value = num_cavalry
    add = num_motorized
    add = num_mechanized
}
```

The fix is to wrap the expression inside `value = { ... }` (short form) or use `var_name = { ... }` (long form). Every math expression in the mod follows one of these two shapes; copy from `00_money_system.txt`, `99_eu_scripted_effects.txt`, `00_productivity_effects.txt`, `!_energy_effects.txt`, `01_missiles_scripted_localisation.txt`, or `01_money_scripted_localisation.txt` if in doubt.

The expression is also the `value` of an **accumulate** effect (`add_to_variable`,
`subtract_from_variable`, `multiply_variable`, `divide_variable`), not just
`set_variable`. This is rare in the codebase (vanilla and MD historically used a
scratch temp instead) but confirmed working in-engine. Prefer it to fold a
single-use temp straight into the accumulate:

```
# Instead of: set_temp_variable = { tmp = { ...expr... } }  then  add_to_variable = { X = tmp }
add_to_variable = {
    var = global.cumulative_world_productivity
    value = {
        value = overall_productivity
        multiply = 0.001
        multiply = population_total_m
    }
}
```

For a self-referencing accumulate (`X = X + expr`) the equivalent
`set_variable = { X = { value = X  add = { ...expr... } } }` also works and reads
the pre-write value, since the full RHS evaluates before assignment.

### Semantics

- **Fixed-point arithmetic** throughout (same as HOI4 variables).
- **Booleans:** `0.0` is false, any other value is true. Comparison/boolean operators return `1.0` (true) or `0.0` (false).
- **Parse failure → `0.0`.** A malformed expression evaluates to zero. It is silent in-game (no tooltip, no crash, the calculation just reads 0), but it **does** log at load: `script_math.cpp:350: Errors occurred while reading math expression defaulting to 0`. Watch for this when a calculation mysteriously reads 0.
- **One bad expression cascades through the rest of the file.** The parser mis-consumes a brace and reads everything after it one level off, so later `set_variable` blocks in unrelated effects report bogus errors (`invalid left side variable: {`, `Math program must start with value =: <token>`). Always fix the **first** `script_math` error in a file and re-run before chasing the others. Brace counts still balance, so a text-level check will not catch it.

### Operators

| Statement                                          | Effect                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`            | Arithmetic on the accumulator              |
| `min`, `max`                                       | Accumulator = min/max of itself and value  |
| `clamp = { min = X max = Y }`                      | Bound accumulator (argument order matters) |
| `greater_than`, `less_than`                        | Return `1.0`/`0.0`                         |
| `round = yes`                                      | Round to nearest integer                   |
| `if = { limit = { ... } ... } else = { ... }`      | `limit` is an expression; true if non-zero |
| `every_collection = { named_collection = X  ... }` | Run statements per element of a collection |

Each operator's argument is itself a full expression, so they nest:

```
greater_than = { value = num_units  multiply = 0.4 }   # accumulator > (num_units * 0.4)
```

**Only `greater_than` and `less_than` are safe comparators.** `equals`, `not_equals`, `greater_than_or_equals`, and `less_than_or_equals` appear in Paradox-adjacent references, but the mod's one use of `equals` inside an `if`'s `limit` (`00_ct_effects.txt`, counter-terror `ambition_chance`) threw a load-time `script_math` error and zeroed the expression, killing every terror-org attack roll. Vanilla never uses anything but `less_than` here (10 uses, zero `equals`), and MD has 29 `greater_than` / 7 `less_than`. `validate_math_expressions.py` reports the sibling-operator, unsafe-comparator and `FROM`-read traps (all three classes on this page) as warnings.

For an equality test, either rewrite as a strict inequality on an integer variable (`equals = 0` on a 0/1/2 value becomes `less_than = 1`), or hoist the branch out of the expression entirely and use a normal effect-level `if` with `check_variable`:

```
# Inside the expression: works, but only with < and >
if = { limit = { value = global.active_terror_org_reach^i  less_than = 1 }  add = 15 }

# Hoisted out: unambiguous, and what to reach for when in doubt
set_temp_variable = { ambition_chance = { value = v  subtract = { ... } } }
if = {
    limit = { check_variable = { global.active_terror_org_reach^i = 0 } }
    add_to_temp_variable = { ambition_chance = 15 }
}
set_temp_variable = { ambition_chance = { value = ambition_chance  multiply = 0.2  round = yes } }
```

Re-assigning a variable from itself (`value = ambition_chance` above) is the standard way to continue an expression after a hoisted branch.

### Verifying a new construct

The engine accepts a construct or silently zeroes it, so **grep for precedent before using anything unfamiliar** in a math expression:

```bash
grep -rn "your_construct" common/ | head        # does MD already ship it?
grep -rn "your_construct" "$HOI4/common/" | head # does vanilla?
```

No hits in either means no evidence it parses. Confirmed working in MD: `^num` as an operand (`01_BRICS_effects.txt:104`), nested operand blocks (`!_energy_effects.txt:254`, `00_influence_scripted_effects.txt:258`), `round = yes` (`bankruptcy_decisions.txt:139`), `clamp = { min max }` (`00_scripted_triggers.txt:494`), dynamic array indices (`array^i`), and `if` inside an expression (vanilla `factions/goals/faction_goals_short_term.txt:266`).

Known broken: reading a variable through the event/on_action `FROM` binding (`value = FROM.debt_bailout`) inside a math expression. It parses cleanly (no `script_math` error) but reads 0 at runtime, zeroing the whole expression (#2464, bailout donors paid $0 but still gained influence); neither vanilla nor MD has a verified working use. `ROOT.`/`THIS.`/`PREV.` reads inside expressions do have working precedent (`00_money_system.txt:920`, `99_eu_scripted_effects.txt:1441`, `00_productivity_effects.txt:33`). Keep the math expression and hoist the FROM read into a plain temp copy it can reference: `set_temp_variable = { bailout_cost = FROM.debt_bailout }` then `set_temp_variable = { treasury_change = { value = bailout_cost  multiply = -0.75 } }`.

## Loop Effects

### `for_each_loop` — iterate over values

```
for_each_loop = {
    array = my_array
    value = v               # current element value (default 'v')
    index = i               # current index (default 'i')
    break = brk             # set this var to non-zero to break (default 'break')
    # effects...
}
```

`v` = the scalar value at position `i`. To scope into a country stored at `i`:

```
var:my_array^i = { ... }   # recommended — uses array name
var:v = { ... }            # also valid — v holds the country reference
```

### `for_each_scope_loop` — iterate and auto-scope

```
for_each_scope_loop = {
    array = my_array
    break = brk             # optional
    tooltip = loc_key       # optional tooltip
    # effects run inside each element's scope automatically
}
```

### `for_loop_effect` — numeric counter loop

```
for_loop_effect = {
    start = 0               # default 0
    end = 10
    compare = less_than     # default less_than; also: less_than_or_equals, greater_than, etc.
    add = 1                 # step (default 1)
    value = v               # loop counter variable (default 'v')
    break = brk             # optional break variable
    # effects...
}
```

### `while_loop_effect` — conditional loop

```
while_loop_effect = {
    limit = { check_variable = { counter < target } }
    # body — must advance the condition or loop exits at 1000
}
```

Engine hard-caps at **1000 iterations** (not configurable). `max_iterations` is **not** a valid key and is silently ignored. Design loops so the realistic worst case stays well below 1000.

## Array / Variable Triggers

### `any_of` — loop, return true if any match

```
any_of = {
    array = my_array
    value = v               # current element scalar (default 'value')
    index = i               # current index (default 'index')
    # triggers — returns true if ALL triggers true for at least one element
}
```

Returns `false` if array is empty or no element satisfies all triggers.

### `all_of` / `any_of_scopes` / `all_of_scopes`

`all_of` — same syntax as `any_of`, returns true only if ALL elements match.

`any_of_scopes` / `all_of_scopes` — auto-scope into each element (no `value`/`index` variables):

```
any_of_scopes = {
    array = my_array
    # triggers evaluated inside each element's scope
}
```

**`any_of` vs `any_of_scopes`:** `any_of` stays in current scope (access via `var:v`); `any_of_scopes` auto-scopes into each element (simpler for country/state arrays).

### `check_variable`

```
check_variable = { my_var > 12 }         # shorthand (also =, <)
check_variable = { var = my_var value = 12 compare = greater_than }  # explicit
```

Compare values: `less_than`, `less_than_or_equals`, `greater_than`, `greater_than_or_equals`, `equals`, `not_equals`.

Inline `>=` and `<=` do not work. Use the explicit `compare` form. These comparator
names do not carry over to math expressions; see [Math Expressions](#math-expressions).

### Other triggers

- `is_in_array = { my_array = 42 }` — check membership
- `var:my_var = { exists = yes }` — check if country in variable actually exists in-game

## Variable and Array Tooltips

Bare variable checks, array checks, and variable/array writes produce no useful
player-facing tooltip. Give visible requirements a `custom_trigger_tooltip` and
summarize effects with `custom_effect_tooltip`, or use an effect's supported
`tooltip = KEY` form. Reuse a localised scripted trigger when it expresses the
requirement, but verify its rendered tooltip rather than assuming the wrapper does.

A failing `visible` hides the object, so it needs no requirement tooltip. AI-only
decisions need neither tooltip wrappers nor localisation. See
[Decision Reference](decision-reference.md) for the exact AI-only gate rules.

For dynamic-modifier writes, use [Dynamic Modifier Tooltips](dynamic-modifier-tooltips.md).

## Dynamic Variables (Read-Only)

Computed by the engine. Full list in `resources/documentation/dynamic_variables_documentation.md` or the [Paradox Wiki — Game variables](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Data_structures#Game_variables).

Common: `global.countries`, `global.majors`, `global.states`, `global.year`, `global.threat`, `num_of_civilian_factories`, `num_of_military_factories`, `stability`, `war_support`, `political_power`, `manpower`, `faction_members`, `allies`, `subjects`.

## Built-in Game Arrays

Engine-provided scope arrays. Usable anywhere an array name is accepted: `target_array = X` on decisions, `array = X` inside `for_each_scope_loop` / `every_country` / `any_of_scopes`, and inside collection operators. Full list on the [Paradox Wiki — Game arrays](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Data_structures#Game_arrays).

| `core_countries` | Countries that consider this state national territory |

### Usage

**For `target_array` on decisions** — the canonical way to scope a targeted decision to a narrow, engine-maintained set of countries. Prefer these over `target_array = global.countries` + a filter trigger, which iterates every country in the game daily.

```
# Good — iterates only current subjects, target_trigger filters within them
target_array = subjects
target_trigger = {
    FROM = { influence_higher_5 = yes }
}

# Good — iterates only land-bordering neighbors
target_array = neighbors
target_trigger = {
    FROM = { check_variable = { FROM.gdp_total > ROOT.gdp_total } }
}

# Worse — iterates every country in the game, relies on trigger to filter
target_array = global.countries
target_trigger = {
    FROM = { is_neighbor_of = ROOT }
}
```

**For `any_of_scopes` / `every_country` / `for_each_scope_loop`** — pass the array name via `array = X`.

```
any_of_scopes = {
    array = faction_members
    NOT = { has_war = yes }
}
```

## Script Collections

Sets of game objects supporting chained operators for filtering and expansion — more efficient than manual array loops for many use cases.

### Structure

```
collection_size = {
    input = {
        input = game:scope              # base input
        operators = { faction_members owned_states }  # chained operators
        name = "States owned by faction" # optional display name
    }
    value > 42
}
```

### Inputs

| Input                         | Description                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |

### Shorthand

```
my_collection = game:all_states   # equivalent to { input = game:all_states }
```

For full collection docs, see `resources/documentation/script_collection_input.md` and `script_collection_operator.md`.

## Script Constants

Reusable constants usable across all script files (unlike file-local `@` macros). No runtime cost. Usage: `constant:numeric_constants.pi`. See `resources/documentation/script_concept_documentation.md`.

## Formatted Localization

Used in `custom_effect_tooltip` and other bindable-loc contexts. Three forms:

```
# Simple loc key
custom_effect_tooltip = MY_TOOLTIP

# Formatter (generates text from game data — e.g., idea description)
custom_effect_tooltip = idea_desc|canadian_pacific_railway

# Bound localization (parameter injection)
custom_effect_tooltip = {
    localization_key = MY_TOOLTIP
    PARAM_NAME = OTHER_LOC_KEY
}
```

Available formatters: `idea_desc`, `idea_name`, `tech_effect`, `advisor_desc`, `country_leader_desc`, `character_name`, `country_culture`, `building_state_modifier`. See `resources/documentation/loc_formatter_documentation.md` for parameters and scope requirements.

### Contextual Localization in Strings

Access scope objects in loc strings using `[Object.Property]` syntax:

```
"[Root.GetName] has signed a treaty with [FROM.GetName]"
"[Root.Capital.GetName] is under threat"
"[This.GetLeader] addresses the nation"
```

Object promotions (scope changes): `Owner`, `Capital`, `OriginalCapital`, `Overlord`, `FactionLeader`, `Controller`, `Occupied`.
Common properties: `GetName`, `GetTag`, `GetFlag`, `GetAdjective`, `GetLeader`, `GetFactionName`.

For full object/property lists, see `resources/documentation/loc_objects_documentation.md`.
