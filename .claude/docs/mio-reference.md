# MIO Reference

Military-Industrial Organization conventions, structure, examples, and valid modifier keys.

## Example MIO

```
CHI_norinco_manufacturer = {
 allowed = { original_tag = CHI }
 icon = GFX_idea_Norinco_CHI

 task_capacity = 18

 equipment_type = {
  infantry_weapons_type
  artillery_equipment
  mio_cat_all_armor
 }

 research_categories = {
  CAT_infrastructure
  CAT_armor
  CAT_artillery
 }

 initial_trait = {
  name = CHI_norinco_trait
  equipment_bonus = {
   reliability = 0.03
   build_cost_ic = -0.03
  }
 }
}
```

## Key Points

- Name MIOs `TAG_organization_name`
- Always include `allowed = { original_tag = TAG }` to restrict to the correct country
- `task_capacity` scales with the org's breadth and nation size, not a formula. Most MIOs omit it — 5 is the MD default (`DEFAULT_INITIAL_TASK_CAPACITY`). When set: 2-3 for small/niche orgs, ~10 for major-nation manufacturers (USA/SOV/FRA/ENG), 18-25 for sprawling multi-category giants (CHI Norinco covers 8 equipment types at 18)
- Equipment types must reference valid `equipment_type` categories
- Trait x positions must not exceed 9. Negative x is valid; y is not capped.
  Use `relative_position_id` for branch internals.
- An **organic network is the default**: branches interleave and cross-link, paths split and reconverge, and cross-branch parents are encouraged (a parent from another branch is fine as long as it sits at a lower `y` than the child). Produce a clean raster/column layout only when explicitly requested.
- A child sits below its parent; vertical spacing may vary for an organic layout, but a child is never on or above its parent's row (`validate_mios.py` reports violations as `trait-geometry-parent-row`)
- Mutually exclusive traits sit on the same row (same `y` value), placed side by side (`trait-geometry-mutex-row` when they don't)
- A parent's connecting line must reach its child without crossing sibling traits on the same row. If it would cross, reposition the child or nudge with `relative_position_id`.
- Children that should inherit from either of two mutually exclusive parents must use `any_parent` (not `parent`) — otherwise picking the "wrong" parent locks the child out (`trait-geometry-mutex-parents`); both geometry checks resolve `relative_position_id` chains and tokens defined in `include`d orgs, and stay silent when a position or token cannot be resolved statically
- Spread `organization_modifier` / `production_bonus` traits across tree depth (near roots, mid-tree, and leaves) rather than clustering them in the bottom rows. Full organic-layout playbook lives in the `mio-builder` skill.
- Name the initial trait `{org_token}_trait` (e.g. `CHI_norinco_trait`)
- `on_complete` always needs `on_complete = { expenditure_for_mio_upgrade = yes }`, unless you add custom effects (idea switch, give a factory, etc.)
- Localisation goes in the country-specific loc file (`localisation/english/MD_focus_TAG`)

## Modifier Keys

Valid modifier keys per block type. Use to verify which keys are legal for a given equipment category.

### Organisation modifiers

Used inside `organization_modifier = { ... }` blocks.

- `military_industrial_organization_design_team_assign_cost` — Cost to assign an MIO in the Tank/Aircraft/Ship designer. Example: `= -0.2`
- `military_industrial_organization_design_team_change_cost` — Cost to pull the latest changes from an already-assigned MIO for a given Tank/Aircraft/Ship design. Example: `= -0.1`
- `military_industrial_organization_funds_gain` — Rate at which funds are obtained (funds level the MIO and unlock traits) — another levelling lever. Example: `= 0.2`
- `military_industrial_organization_industrial_manufacturer_assign_cost` — Cost to assign a MIO to an industrial (non-designer) production line. Example: `= -0.2`
- `military_industrial_organization_research_bonus` — Flat increase to the MIO's research bonus percentage: 20% plus "0.1" here gives 30%. Example: `= 0.1`
- `military_industrial_organization_size_up_requirement` — Modifies funds needed per level, speeding trait unlocks; for MIOs with above-average trait counts. Example: `= -0.1`
- `military_industrial_organization_task_capacity` — Flat increase to the number of tasks an MIO can be assigned in parallel. Example: `= 5`

### Production modifiers

Used inside `production_bonus = { ... }` blocks. Equipment types the key applies to in parentheses.

Ships are built in dockyards, which have no production-efficiency mechanic, so the three `(non-naval)` keys below are wholly inert on a naval roster. `validate_mios.py` enforces it: `mio-production-bonus-naval` (ERROR, gates) when every equipment the trait reaches is a ship, `mio-production-bonus-partial-naval` (WARNING) when only part of it is. Use `production_capacity_factor`, `production_cost_factor`, `production_resource_need_factor` or `production_resource_penalty_factor` on a naval MIO instead.

- `production_capacity_factor` (All) — Increases production output (items produced per day). Example: `= 0.1`
- `production_conversion_speed_factor` (non-naval) — Speed at which equipment conversions are performed. Example: `= 0.5`
- `production_cost_factor` (All) — Reduces production cost. Example: `= 0.05`
- `production_efficiency_cap_factor` (non-naval) — Increase max production efficiency. Ships have no production efficiency cap. Example: `= 0.2`
- `production_efficiency_gain_factor` (non-naval) — Increase the rate efficiency increases. Ships have no production efficiency cap. Example: `= 0.24`
- `production_resource_need_factor` (All) — Change raw resources needed (Iron, Tungsten, Chromium, etc.). Example: `= -0.1`
- `production_resource_penalty_factor` (All) — Modify the penalty from not having enough resources. Example: `= -0.1`

### Equipment modifiers

Used inside `equipment_bonus = { ... }` blocks.

**A bonus is a percentage of the equipment's declared base stat, so a key the target equipment never declares — or declares as `0` — does nothing.** Parser-legal is not the same as effective: the tables below say which keys the engine accepts for a category, not which ones bite on a given archetype. `AA_Equipment` (MANPADS) declares only `reliability`, `build_cost_ic`, `supply_consumption`, `lend_lease_cost` and `air_attack`, so every other key is inert on it; `infantry_weapons_type` declares `ap_attack = 0` and `armor_value = 0`, which is no better than omitting them. Check the archetype in `common/units/equipment/` before picking a stat. `validate_mios.py` reports the dead ones as `mio-bonus-no-base-stat` / `mio-bonus-partial-base-stat`, both ERROR-severity and gating. When a stat only bites on part of the org's roster, narrow the trait with `limit_to_equipment_type` or swap the stat for one every member declares — but note the limit is trait-level, so it restricts the trait's `production_bonus` as well. `initial_trait` is exempt from the partial check, since an org has only one and cannot split it.
