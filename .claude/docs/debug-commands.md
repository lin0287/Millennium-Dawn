# Quick Debug Commands

In-game console recipes for testing Millennium Dawn systems, with a focus on the
European Union / USoE subsystem. Paste these into the HOI4 console while running the
mod.

> All identifiers below are verified against the current codebase. When a recipe calls
> a scripted effect, the effect name is the exact one defined in `common/scripted_effects/`.

## Console basics

| Command               | Effect                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `` ` `` / `~` / `²`   | Open the console (key depends on keyboard layout)                   |
| `debug`               | Toggle the master debug overlay                                     |
| `tdebug`              | Toggle on-map tooltips (province IDs, state IDs, variable readouts) |
| `tag TAG`             | Switch the country you control (e.g. `tag GER`)                     |
| `observe` / `tag ---` | Drop into observer mode                                             |
| `event <id>`          | Fire an event on the player (e.g. `event EUevent.3`)                |
| `effect <script>`     | Run arbitrary effect script in the **player country** scope         |

### Running MD scripted effects

The `effect` console command executes any effect block in the player's scope. This is the
primary way to drive MD systems by hand:

```
effect add_ideas = EU_member
effect apply_USoE_technologies = yes
effect set_variable = { global.current_active_agenda_disp = 203 }
```

You can chain multiple statements in one `effect` call:

```
effect = { add_ideas = EU_member set_country_flag = EU_candidate }
```

## Inspecting variables, flags, and arrays

HOI4 has no direct "print variable" console command. Three practical options:

1. **`tdebug` tooltips** — hover a country/state with debug tooltips on to read its
   variables and flags inline.
2. **Log dump** — write the value to the game log, then read
   `~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/logs/game.log`:

   ```
   effect log = "EU_passed_votes^0 = [?global.EU_passed_votes^0]"
   effect log = "active agenda = [?global.current_active_agenda_disp], active vote = [?global.current_active_vote_disp]"
   ```

3. **Scripted-loc readout** — most EU display values already surface through the EU GUI;
   open the relevant panel after changing state.

## EU / USoE debug recipes

### Become or drop EU membership

```
# Join: the EU_member idea's on_add pushes THIS into global.EU_member
effect add_ideas = EU_member

# Leave: on_remove pops THIS from global.EU_member and runs leaving_EU
effect remove_ideas = EU_member
```

### Mark a passed agenda without running a full vote

`global.EU_passed_votes` is the source of truth for "agenda EUxxx passed". Every
`focus_EUxxx_accepted` trigger reads it.

```
# Record that EU203 passed (opens every gate keyed on focus_EU203_accepted)
effect add_to_array = { global.EU_passed_votes = 203 }

# Undo
effect remove_from_array = { global.EU_passed_votes = 203 }
```

### Force a council (QMV) vote outcome

The QMV resolvers are `focus_EUxxx_QMV_result`. They branch on
`EU_voting_decision_result_trigger`; the YES branch calls
`cleanup_european_union_voting` with `vote_passed = 1` (which records the pass in `EU_passed_votes`).

```
# Set the active vote, then resolve it as passed
effect set_variable = { global.current_active_vote_disp = 203 }
effect focus_EU203_QMV_result = yes
```

### Form the United States of Europe (EU111)

The full formation runs through `focus_EU111_QMV_result` (annexes members, transfers
cores, applies pooled tech). As a member-state player:

```
effect focus_EU111_QMV_result = yes
```

The legacy event path (`EUevent.3`) does the same thing but is currently unreferenced;
fire it directly only for isolated testing:

```
event EUevent.3
```

### Test pooled technology transfer (`apply_USoE_technologies`)

`apply_USoE_technologies` pools every `global.EU_member`'s researched techs onto `EUU`
(the tech-bank tag), then applies the union to ROOT. **Precondition:** `EUU` must already
hold each member's tech, so load it first:

```
effect = {
    for_each_scope_loop = { array = global.EU_member  EUU = { inherit_technology = PREV } }
    apply_USoE_technologies = yes
}
```

`apply_USoE_technologies` builds `ROOT.eu_technologies`, applies each token via
`set_technology`, then clears the array — so nothing lingers in the save afterward.

### Recompute the EU Parliament

```
effect clear_EU_Parliament = yes      # wipe all PG flags + per-party globals
effect election_EU_Parliament = yes   # recompute MEP totals / majority
```

## Key EU state handles

| Handle                              | Kind          | Meaning                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `global.EU_member`                  | country array | Current EU member states                  |
| `global.EU_potential`               | country array | Candidate / potential members             |
| `global.EU_passed_votes`            | int array     | Passed agenda IDs (source of truth)       |
| `global.EU_council_votes`           | int array     | Agenda IDs currently in council voting    |
| `global.current_active_agenda_disp` | int           | Agenda being voted in the EP (0 = none)   |
| `global.current_active_vote_disp`   | int           | Agenda in the council vote (0 = none)     |
| `EU_member`                         | idea          | Membership (see note)                     |
| `USoE`                              | country flag  | Set on the formed United States of Europe |
| `USoE_member`                       | country flag  | Set on each nation folded into the USoE   |
| `EUU`                               | tag           | Tech-bank country pooling member techs    |

Note: the `EU_member` idea's `on_add`/`on_remove` maintain `global.EU_member`.
