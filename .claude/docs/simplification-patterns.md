# Simplification Patterns for HOI4 Scripted Effects

Patterns for reducing complexity, eliminating copy-paste drift, and making scripts easier to maintain.

Use a pattern only when it preserves behavior and makes the code easier to read.
A helper or lookup table must remove meaningful duplication, not just a few lines.
Check scope, evaluation order, side effects, and tooltips before calling a rewrite safe.

## Local Simplifications

- Trigger contexts already AND their children. Do not add a redundant `AND` wrapper.
- An AI modifier whose `OR` covers every value of a condition is unconditional.
  Remove the tautology and fold its additive weight into `base` where equivalent.
- Use `if`/`else` for complementary branches. Two `if` blocks can both execute when
  the first changes state read by the second.
- Prefer flat checks when they express the same relationship:
  `TAG = { exists = yes }` becomes `country_exists = TAG`;
  `TAG = { has_war_with = ROOT }` becomes `has_war_with = TAG` when current scope is ROOT.
  Verify direction rather than replacing scope blocks mechanically. In particular,
  `TAG = { is_puppet = yes }` does not mean `is_puppet_of = TAG`: one checks TAG's
  status, the other checks the current country's relationship to TAG.

## Array Lookup Tables

When you have N parallel values indexed by a small integer type (1..N), use an array instead of N individual variables.

### Before (14 globals + 14 branches)

```
set_variable = { global.BUILD_COST_CIVILIAN_FACTORY = 12 }
set_variable = { global.BUILD_COST_MILITARY_FACTORY = 12.50 }
# ... 12 more ...

if = { limit = { check_variable = { type = 1 } }
    set_variable = { cost = global.BUILD_COST_CIVILIAN_FACTORY }
}
else_if = { limit = { check_variable = { type = 2 } }
    set_variable = { cost = global.BUILD_COST_MILITARY_FACTORY }
}
# ... 12 more ...
```

### After (one array + one lookup)

```
set_variable = { global.build_cost_array^1 = 12 }
set_variable = { global.build_cost_array^2 = 12.50 }
# ... 12 more ...

set_temp_variable = { idx = type }
set_variable = { cost = global.build_cost_array^idx }
```

**Why:** Eliminates copy-paste drift, reduces script size by ~80%, adding a new type is one line instead of two.

**Caveat:** HOI4 arrays are zero-indexed. Reserve `^0` as a safe default (set to 0 or a sentinel) so an uninitialized index doesn't read garbage.

## Parameterized Scripted Localisation

Scripted localisation (`defined_text`) has no function parameters. Use a temp variable as a "parameter" to collapse N near-identical blocks.

### Before (N blocks, one per slot)

```
defined_text = {
    name = my_feature_get_slot_text_0
    text = { trigger = { check_variable = { slot_array^0 = 1 } } localization_key = cancelled }
    text = { localization_key = my_feature_slot_0_text }
}
defined_text = {
    name = my_feature_get_slot_text_1
    # ... identical structure, different index ...
}
# ... N more ...
```

### After (one block reading a temp var)

```
# Caller sets the temp variable before using the loc key
set_temp_variable = { selected_slot_type = slot_type_array^slot }

defined_text = {
    name = my_feature_get_slot_type
    text = { trigger = { check_variable = { selected_slot_type = 1 } } localization_key = type_one_loc }
    text = { trigger = { check_variable = { selected_slot_type = 2 } } localization_key = type_two_loc }
    # ... etc ...
}
```

**Why:** Scripted loc has no arrays or parameterized blocks. A temp variable set by the caller is the only way to share logic across slots.

## Extract Repeated Tail Blocks into Helpers

When multiple functions end with identical logic, extract the tail into a helper.

### Before

Every `AI_get_*_score` ended with:

```
set_temp_variable_to_random = { var = state_randomizer min = -15 max = 15 integer = yes }
add_to_temp_variable = { AI_score = state_randomizer }
if = { limit = { check_variable = { AI_score > AI_best_score } }
    set_temp_variable = { AI_best_score = AI_score }
    set_temp_variable = { AI_best_target = THIS.id }
    set_temp_variable = { AI_best_type = 1 }
}
```

### After

```
AI_record_score = {
    set_temp_variable_to_random = { var = state_randomizer min = -15 max = 15 integer = yes }
    add_to_temp_variable = { AI_score = state_randomizer }
    if = { limit = { check_variable = { AI_score > AI_best_score } }
        set_temp_variable = { AI_best_score = AI_score }
        set_temp_variable = { AI_best_target = THIS.id }
        set_temp_variable = { AI_best_type = AI_score_type }
    }
}
```

Each caller now ends with:

```
set_temp_variable = { AI_score_type = 1 }  # or 2, 3, etc.
AI_record_score = yes
```

**Why:** ~40 lines of duplication removed per score function. If the randomization range needs tuning, one change updates every score type.

## Replace Nested `if` Toggle with `if/else`

### Before

```
if = { limit = { check_variable = { page = 1 } } add_to_variable = { page = 1 } }
else_if = { limit = { check_variable = { page = 2 } } set_variable = { page = 1 } }
```

### After

```
if = { limit = { check_variable = { page = 1 } } set_variable = { page = 2 } }
else = { set_variable = { page = 1 } }
```

**Why:** Two-state toggles are cleaner with `if/else`. The `else` branch is guaranteed to execute when the `if` doesn't, removing the need for a second trigger check.

## Collapse Government-Match Ideology Enumerations

An `OR` of `AND`s comparing the current scope's government to one other country, one ideology at a time, is just the engine-native country comparison: a country has only one government, so only its own ideology's clause can match.

```
OR = {
 AND = { has_government = democratic  FROM = { has_government = democratic } }
 # ... one AND per ideology group ...
}
# same gov      -> has_government = FROM
# different gov -> NOT = { has_government = FROM }
```

Collapse **only when all five groups are enumerated** — a partial set changes meaning for the omitted groups (a latent bug, not a mechanical simplification). Keep the comparison scope exact: the bare `has_government = X` is `THIS`, the named scope is the target. Five-branch `if`/`else_if` chains keyed on `has_government`, and the removed `is_same_government` / `has_same_ideology` triggers, reduce the same way. `tools/validation/validate_simplifications.py` flags the safe (exhaustive) cases.

## Consolidate Identical-Body `else_if` Chains into `OR`

When N consecutive `else_if` branches all execute the same effects, collapse them into one branch with an `OR` limit.

### Before (N branches, same body)

```
else_if = { limit = { has_country_flag = flag_A } add_stability = 0.05 }
else_if = { limit = { has_country_flag = flag_B } add_stability = 0.05 }
else_if = { limit = { has_country_flag = flag_C } add_stability = 0.05 }
else_if = { limit = { has_country_flag = flag_D } add_stability = 0.05 }
else_if = { limit = { has_country_flag = flag_E } add_stability = 0.05 }
```

### After (one branch, OR'd conditions)

```
else_if = {
    limit = {
        OR = {
            has_country_flag = flag_A
            has_country_flag = flag_B
            has_country_flag = flag_C
            has_country_flag = flag_D
            has_country_flag = flag_E
        }
    }
    add_stability = 0.05
}
```

**Go a step further, use `else` when exhaustive:** If the preceding `if/else_if` chain already guarantees at least one condition must be true (e.g., earlier branches covered all lower values of a sequential range), use a bare `else = { ... }` instead of the `OR` block. Shorter and can't drift.

**Why:** Eliminates copy-paste drift, adding a new condition doesn't risk forgetting to update one branch. Reduces script size. If the body changes, it's one edit instead of N.

**When NOT to use:** If the branches have side effects that interact (e.g., scoping to different targets, setting variables the next branch reads), or if evaluation order matters between conditions that could both be true. `OR` short-circuits logic, all conditions are effectively equal.

## Consolidate Decision Templates with `meta_effect`

When you have N decisions that differ only by an index, use `meta_effect` rather than N copies.

```
meta_effect = {
    text = {
        activate_decision = my_feature_slot_[INDEX]_decision
        var:slot_target_country^slot = {
            set_variable = { slot_target_duration = PREV.slot_duration^PREV.slot }
            activate_targeted_decision = { target = PREV decision = my_feature_slot_[INDEX]_target_decision }
        }
    }
    INDEX = "[?slot]"
}
```

**Why:** The N decisions still exist as separate objects (engine requirement, decision IDs must be static), but their activation logic is a single block. Adding a new slot is a parameter increment instead of N more lines.

**Caveat:** `meta_effect` runs at parse time, not runtime. It cannot reference runtime variables in its parameter substitution, only static text or `[]`-formatted variables.

## Migrate Per-Index Flags + `meta_trigger`/`meta_effect` to Runtime Arrays

This is the inverse of the section above, and the more common cleanup. `meta_effect`/`meta_trigger` is the right tool when fanning out over **static identifiers** (decision IDs, focus IDs — things the engine requires to exist at parse time). It is the **wrong** tool when used to fan out over **runtime per-index state** — a set of flags like `POTEF_nominee_0..23`, `focus_[EUXXX]_EP_agenda`, or `[PG_X]_influence`. That anti-pattern creates N country flags plus N parse-time meta blocks where a single runtime array or variable would do, and the per-nation expansion balloons scripted localisation (the EU subsystem shed ~16,000 generated lines this way).

The EU subsystem (`common/scripted_effects/99_eu_scripted_effects.txt`, `99_EU_voting_scripted_effects.txt`, `common/decisions/EU_*`, `common/scripted_triggers/99_EU_*`) is the reference implementation.

### Before (one country flag per index + a meta block to set/scan them)

```
# Set the per-index flag via parse-time substitution
meta_effect = {
    text = { set_country_flag = POTEF_nominee_[subideology] }
    subideology = "[?var_gov_index|0]"
}

# Scan all 24 flags to ask "has anyone nominated?"
NOT = {
    OR = {
        has_country_flag = POTEF_nominee_0
        has_country_flag = POTEF_nominee_1
        # ... 22 more ...
    }
}
```

### After (one global array indexed by the runtime value)

```
# Store the nominating country's id at the subideology slot. 0 = unset.
set_variable = { global.POTEF_nominee_country^var_gov_index = THIS.id }

# A single flat check replaces the 24-flag scan.
NOT = { check_variable = { global.POTEF_nominee_country^var_gov_index value = 0 compare = greater_than } }
```

**Why:** Removes N flags and the meta block entirely; the index is now a real runtime variable so loops (`for_each_loop`), lookups, and display loc all read one source of truth. Adding a slot is no code change at all.

### Sentinel-value gating with country IDs

Storing a **country id** in an array slot doubles as a set/unset sentinel: runtime country ids are always `> 0` (id 0 is reserved for rebels and never held by a live EU member), so `check_variable = { slot > 0 }` means "this slot is filled" and resetting the slot to `0` clears it. An uninitialized slot reads `0` and fails the gate safely — no `has_country_flag` needed. Use `compare = greater_than` (or `not_equals 0`); never inline `>=`/`<=` (invalid; see [Data Structures](hoi4-data-structures.md#check_variable)).

### Set ↔ clear symmetry is mandatory

Every flag or array slot that gates a **cycle** (an election, a vote, an agenda) must have a clear site that is actually reached when the cycle ends. Trace the full lifecycle before merging:

1. **Init** — set/reset at EU startup (`on_startup`-driven effect) so a fresh game and a reloaded save both have a defined value.
2. **Write** — set when the triggering event happens (nomination, vote pass).
3. **Clear** — reset to `0` / `clr_country_flag` at cycle end so the next cycle can run.

A flag that is set but never cleared (or a slot never reset) silently locks the next cycle out. Grep every set site against every clear site — asymmetry is the bug. Reference: `clear_potef_electoral_values` resets every `global.POTEF_nominee_country^v` and clears `POTEF_has_nominated` for all members at election end.

### Permanent ledger vs cycle-state — decide which you are building

- **Cycle-state** (`global.current_active_agenda_disp`, the nominee slots): reset every cycle. Visibility gates read it (`> 0` = a cycle is live).
- **Permanent ledger** (`global.EU_passed_votes`): an append-only record of what has ever passed, read-only via `is_in_array`, intentionally **never** cleared. Replacing a per-country `any_of_scopes { has_country_flag = focus_EU202_yes }` scan with `is_in_array = { array = global.EU_passed_votes value = 202 }` is correct **only** if something appends 202 to that array when the vote passes (`cleanup_european_union_voting` does, with the caller setting `vote_passed = 1`). A ledger that is read but never written is permanently false.

Document which kind each array is in a one-line comment at its first write site — they look identical but reviewers must know whether a missing clear is a bug or intentional.

### Loop type follows the array contents

Numeric-index arrays (vote ids, subideology indices, token arrays) use `for_each_loop`. Scope-object arrays (countries, states — e.g. `global.EU_member`) use `for_each_scope_loop`. Mismatching them silently no-ops or misbehaves. See [Data Structures](hoi4-data-structures.md#loop-effects).

### Scripted-loc fallthrough

When the display moves from a per-flag scriptloc to one variable-driven `defined_text`, every reachable input value still needs a matching `text` entry or a final catch-all `text` with no `trigger`. A `defined_text` that falls through with no match renders **blank** (or a literal `[token]`). Check the idle state (`current_active_agenda_disp = 0`) and the empty/all-one-party cases.

### Clean up what the migration orphans

Removing the flags/triggers leaves dead artifacts — sweep them in the same change:

- **`!_cwtools_dummy_effects.txt`** stubs for the removed flags/effects.
- **Orphaned English loc keys** for removed triggers/tooltips (e.g. `tooltip_influence_on_leader_of_EU_trade_policy_25_percent`). Grep the key across `common/ events/ interface/` first — and watch for keys assembled dynamically (`tooltip_[token]`), which a literal grep misses. English source keys are safe to delete; never touch other-language files (Paratranz-managed).

---

## Consolidate `custom_effect_tooltip` + `effect_tooltip` + `for_each_scope_loop`

When a focus, decision, or event shows a tooltip for effects applied to every member of an array, the old pattern duplicated the same logic twice: once in `effect_tooltip` (for display) and once in `for_each_scope_loop` (for execution). The `for_each_scope_loop` block accepts a `tooltip` parameter, which combines both.

### Before (self-targeting effects)

```
custom_effect_tooltip = TT_ALL_NATO_MEMBER_NATIONS_GAIN
effect_tooltip = {
    add_popularity = { ideology = nationalist popularity = 0.05 }
    add_war_support = -0.10
    add_stability = -0.05
}
for_each_scope_loop = {
    array = global.nato_members
    add_popularity = { ideology = nationalist popularity = 0.05 }
    add_war_support = -0.10
    add_stability = -0.05
}
```

### After (self-targeting effects)

```
for_each_scope_loop = {
    array = global.nato_members
    tooltip = TT_ALL_NATO_MEMBER_NATIONS_GAIN
    add_popularity = { ideology = nationalist popularity = 0.05 }
    add_war_support = -0.10
    add_stability = -0.05
}
```

### Before (opinion modifiers with explicit target)

```
custom_effect_tooltip = TT_ALL_NATO_MEMBER_NATIONS_GAIN
effect_tooltip = {
    add_opinion_modifier = { target = DEN modifier = drama }
}
for_each_scope_loop = {
    array = global.nato_members
    add_opinion_modifier = { target = DEN modifier = drama }
}
```

### After (opinion modifiers with explicit target)

```
for_each_scope_loop = {
    array = global.nato_members
    tooltip = TT_ALL_NATO_MEMBER_NATIONS_GAIN
    if = {
        limit = { NOT = { tag = ROOT } }
        add_opinion_modifier = { target = ROOT modifier = drama }
    }
}
```

**Key differences:**

- `tooltip = TT_ALL_*` replaces both `custom_effect_tooltip` and `effect_tooltip`.
- The effects live in one place: inside the `for_each_scope_loop`.
- When opinion modifiers target the focus-completing country, add `NOT = { tag = ROOT }` to prevent self-targeting. Use `ROOT` (not `PREV`): `ROOT` is the fixed original scope, while `PREV` shifts if the loop is nested inside another scope change.

**Why:** Eliminates ~4-8 lines of duplication per call site. Across ~50+ EU/NATO/CSTO/AU focus trees, scripted effects, and GUI buttons, this removes hundreds of redundant lines and prevents drift between tooltip text and real execution. See `.claude/docs/performance-patterns.md` for the performance impact of double-evaluation.

## Merge Consecutive Same-Tag Scope Blocks

When two or more scope blocks target the same country tag in sequence, merge them into one. Each scope switch adds a nesting level to the in-game tooltip, making it harder to read.

### Before

```
ALG = {
    country_event = nuclear_algeria.19
}
ALG = {
    add_opinion_modifier = {
        target = ROOT
        modifier = sanctioned_us
    }
}
```

### After

```
ALG = {
    country_event = nuclear_algeria.19
    add_opinion_modifier = {
        target = ROOT
        modifier = sanctioned_us
    }
}
```

**Why:** Each `TAG = { }` scope switch creates a separate indented block in the player-facing tooltip. Two consecutive `ALG = { }` blocks show the ALG header twice, making the tooltip noisy. Merging produces a single clean block.

**When NOT to merge:** If the two blocks are separated by an `if`/`else` that conditionally gates one of them, or if the second block is inside a different trigger/effect context (e.g., one is in `effect_tooltip` and the other is in `hidden_effect`), they cannot be merged.

## Prefer `multiply_variable` Over `divide_variable`

Division is more expensive than multiplication and carries a divide-by-zero risk. When dividing by a constant, multiply by its reciprocal instead.

### Before

```
divide_variable = { var = my_ratio value = 100 }
```

### After

```
multiply_variable = { var = my_ratio value = 0.01 }
```

**Why:** `multiply_variable` is a single engine operation with no zero-division risk. `0.01` is the exact reciprocal of `100`, so the result is identical. Prefer multiplication for all constant divisors.

## Fold a Single-Use Temp into the Accumulate Effect

A scratch temp that is built up only to be added to (or multiplied into) one target on the next line is pure overhead. A math expression is a valid `value` for the accumulate effects (`add_to_variable`, `subtract_from_variable`, `multiply_variable`, `divide_variable`), not just `set_variable` — so fold the build straight in.

### Before (temp built, used once)

```
set_temp_variable = { cumulative_productivity = overall_productivity }
multiply_temp_variable = { cumulative_productivity = 0.001 }
multiply_temp_variable = { cumulative_productivity = population_total_m }
add_to_variable = { global.cumulative_world_productivity = cumulative_productivity }
```

### After (no temp)

```
add_to_variable = {
    var = global.cumulative_world_productivity
    value = {
        value = overall_productivity
        multiply = 0.001
        multiply = population_total_m
    }
}
```

**Why:** One single-pass expression replaces three temp writes plus the add, and drops the temp variable entirely. Only fold a temp that is read exactly once — keep it when the intermediate is reused by several later statements.

**Caveat:** Accumulate-with-math-expression is rare (vanilla and MD historically used a temp), but confirmed working in-engine. A self-referencing accumulate can also be written `set_variable = { X = { value = X  add = { ...expr... } } }`, which reads the pre-write value of `X`. See `.claude/docs/hoi4-data-structures.md` (Math Expressions).

**Do not fold a branch into the expression.** Folding straight-line arithmetic is safe. Folding an `if` in is where this pattern bites: a malformed expression does not fail loudly, it evaluates to `0.0` and the game plays on with a dead mechanic. A counter-terror fold that moved `if = { limit = { check_variable = { X = 0 } } add_to_temp_variable = { Y = 15 } }` into the expression as `if = { limit = { value = X equals = 0 } add = 15 }` zeroed the whole attack-chance roll, so no terror organization ever attacked, and it desynced the parser for four unrelated effects further down the file. Only `greater_than` and `less_than` are safe comparators inside an expression. Keep the `if` at effect level with `check_variable` unless you have grepped precedent for the exact form you are writing.

**Verify folds by loading the game and reading `error.log`.** Neither pre-commit nor CI catches a math expression that parses to zero. Fix the first `script_math.cpp` error in a file, then re-run: the rest are usually cascade from that one.

## Prefer `random` Over Two-Bucket `random_list` With an Empty Side

When a `random_list` has exactly two buckets and one is empty (a "do nothing" placeholder for the "miss" case), collapse it to `random = { chance = N effect }`. Same semantics, lighter engine path, less script.

### Before

```
random_list = {
    50 = { add_to_variable = { event_counter = 1 } }
    50 = {}
}
```

or with the empty bucket first:

```
random_list = {
    80 = { }
    20 = { increase_corruption = yes }
}
```

### After

```
random = {
    chance = 50
    add_to_variable = { event_counter = 1 }
}
```

```
random = {
    chance = 20
    increase_corruption = yes
}
```

**Why:** `random_list` builds a weighted-list dispatch table internally; the engine resolves the active bucket on every fire. `random = { chance = N effect }` is a direct Bernoulli trial: one roll, branch, done. Also less code and easier to read: the probability and effect appear together.

**When NOT to convert:** Three or more buckets, or two non-empty buckets with different effects. Those genuinely need `random_list`. The chance value must be the weight of the non-empty bucket: `random_list = { 80 = {} 20 = { effect } }` becomes `random = { chance = 20 effect }`, not `chance = 80`.

## Add Mutual Exclusion Guards When Splitting `every_country` with `OR`

When converting a single `every_country = { limit = { OR = { A B } } }` into separate loops (e.g., one per array), add exclusion limits so countries matching multiple conditions don't receive effects twice.

### Before (single loop)

```
every_country = {
    limit = { OR = { has_idea = group_A has_idea = group_B } }
    country_event = { id = my_event.1 days = 2 }
}
```

### After (split loops with exclusion)

```
for_each_scope_loop = {
    array = global.group_A_members
    if = {
        limit = { NOT = { has_idea = group_B } }
        country_event = { id = my_event.1 days = 2 }
    }
}
every_country = {
    limit = { has_idea = group_B }
    country_event = { id = my_event.1 days = 2 }
}
```

Note the inner `if`: `for_each_scope_loop` has no top-level `limit` parameter (see the conversion section below).

**Why:** The original single loop guaranteed each country received the effect exactly once. Splitting without guards causes countries in both groups to fire or receive the effect multiple times. This silently introduces double-firing events, stacked opinion modifiers, or duplicated resource transfers.

Apply the same pattern whenever a non-idempotent effect (opinion modifiers, variable changes, events, etc.) is split across multiple loops.

## Convert `every_country` Over Bloc Membership to `for_each_scope_loop`

When an `every_country` or `every_other_country` loop filters on a bloc-membership idea that a maintained global array backs, iterate the array instead. `every_country` walks all 200+ tags; the array holds only the ~30 members (see `.claude/docs/performance-patterns.md` § "Prefer Engine Arrays Over every_country / any_country" for the performance rationale).

Array-backed membership ideas (`check_common_mistakes.py` flags these automatically):

| Idea                              | Array                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `NATO_member`                     | `global.nato_members`        |
| `EU_member`                       | `global.EU_member`           |
| `CSTO_member`                     | `global.CSTO_member`         |
| `AU_member`                       | `global.AU_member`           |
| `LoAS_member` / `LoAS_member_upd` | `global.arab_league_members` |
| `OAU_member`                      | `global.OAU_member`          |
| `ecowas_member_state`             | `global.ECOWAS_member`       |
| `idea_gcc_member_state`           | `global.gcc_member_state`    |
| `faction_warsaw_pact_idea`        | `global.WARSAW_PACT_member`  |
| `RAJ_BRICS_associate`             | `global.BRICS_associates`    |
| `RAJ_BRICS_observer`              | `global.BRICS_observers`     |

Ideas backed by TWO arrays (`p5_member`, `at_member`, `RAJ_BRICS`) cannot convert to a single array loop — leave those as `every_country`, or loop the primary array and re-check the idea inside.

Array names are inconsistently pluralized — copy the exact spelling. These arrays are synced to the ideas via `on_add`/`on_remove` hooks on the idea definitions. Other bloc arrays exist (`global.mercosur_member_state`, `global.gcc_member_state`) but have no idea-based membership test; loops over them are usually already array-based.

The LoAS pair is a special case: a `swap_ideas` upgrade (Egypt's `EGY_arab_league_tigh`) means a member holds exactly ONE of the two variants, so a loop filtering `has_idea = LoAS_member` alone silently misses upgraded members. The array covers both — converting these loops is a correctness fix, not just a perf one.

### Before

```
every_country = {
    limit = {
        has_idea = NATO_member
        is_european_nation = yes
    }
    add_war_support = 0.05
}
```

### After

```
for_each_scope_loop = {
    array = global.nato_members
    tooltip = TT_ALL_NATO_MEMBER_NATIONS_GAIN
    if = {
        limit = { is_european_nation = yes }
        add_war_support = 0.05
    }
}
```

Conversion recipe:

- Drop the membership condition — the array guarantees it.
- `for_each_scope_loop` has **no top-level `limit`**: re-express any residual conditions as an inner `if = { limit = { ... } }`.
- The loop auto-scopes into each member, same as `every_country` — the body needs no rewriting. The loop-entry country is `PREV`/`ROOT` inside the body; prefer `ROOT` when the loop may be nested (see the tooltip-consolidation section above).
- **Tooltips are mandatory in player-facing contexts** (focus rewards, decision effects, event options): `for_each_scope_loop` produces no automatic tooltip, unlike `every_country`. Add `tooltip = TT_ALL_*` inside the loop (`TT_ALL_NATO_MEMBER_NATIONS_GAIN` is the canonical key), or keep a single summary `custom_effect_tooltip` outside it. Never pair the loop with a duplicate `effect_tooltip` — that reintroduces the double-write the tooltip-consolidation section removes.
- `every_other_country` additionally needs a self-exclusion guard, since the array includes the acting country:

```
for_each_scope_loop = {
    array = global.nato_members
    if = {
        limit = { NOT = { tag = ROOT } }
        add_opinion_modifier = { target = ROOT modifier = NATO_member_modifier }
    }
}
```

### Trigger contexts

`for_each_scope_loop` is an **effect** — it cannot appear in `available`/`visible`/`limit` blocks. The trigger-side conversion targets `any_of_scopes` / `all_of_scopes`:

```
# Before — walks all tags
any_other_country = {
    has_idea = NATO_member
    has_war_with = ROOT
}

# After — checks only members
any_of_scopes = {
    array = global.nato_members
    has_war_with = ROOT
}
```

**Stale-entry caveat:** annexed or collapsed tags can linger in membership arrays. `on_annex` strips the annexed country from all bloc arrays via `remove_from_bloc_membership_arrays` (`common/scripted_effects/01_international_systems_effects.txt`), but old saves and unwired death paths still leave entries behind. Effect loops auto-skip non-existent scopes; trigger aggregations do **not** — an `all_of_scopes` over the array can become permanently unsatisfiable (the #2026 NATO ratification deadlock). Give every `all_of_scopes` (and any negated `any_of_scopes`) an existence escape:

```
all_of_scopes = {
    array = global.nato_members
    OR = {
        has_country_flag = NATO_Ratified_@ROOT
        exists = no
    }
}
```

**When NOT to convert:**

- The array is not maintained on join/leave. Before wiring `on_add`/`on_remove` on a new bloc idea, its array only reflects the startup seed list — converting a loop over it silently drops runtime joiners. Verify the idea definition carries the array hooks first.
- The limit mixes an array-backed idea with non-array conditions in an `OR` (splitting needs the mutual-exclusion guards from the section above).
- The loop relies on `every_country` reaching non-members (e.g. applying an effect to everyone _except_ members via `NOT`).

## Consolidate Near-Identical Event Families into One Generic Event

When N events share identical option effect bodies and differ only in title/desc and ai_chance weights, collapse them into one event keyed on the type variable. UN.6-21, UN.410-421, and UNSC.1-4 collapsed from 32 events (~2,800 lines) to 3 this way, with zero loc churn.

### Recipe

1. Verify the family first: option ORDER must match (the first option is the timeout default) and option effect bodies must be identical. Catalog every ai_chance difference per type.
2. Keep the lowest event id as the generic event. Add one triggered `title`/`desc` block per type, reusing the EXISTING loc keys:

```
title = {
 trigger = { check_variable = { global.current_ga_vote_type = 6 } }
 text = UN.6.t
}
title = {
 trigger = { check_variable = { global.current_ga_vote_type = 7 } }
 text = UN.7.t
}
```

1. Merge ai_chance mechanically: group each `(add, condition)` modifier by the set of types that carry it, then emit one modifier per group, gated with `check_variable` / `OR` / range checks. If option bases differ across types, use `base = 0` plus a per-type gated `add`. Then re-expand the merged block per type and diff against the originals; the multisets must match exactly or you changed AI behavior.
2. Replace the dispatch (`meta_effect` or if/else_if chain) with one literal `country_event`.
3. Delete the collapsed events. Keep all their `.t`/`.d` loc keys (the triggered blocks reference them). Delete orphaned per-event option keys only after a repo-wide grep.

### The delayed-fire trap

Triggered titles/descs and ai_chance evaluate at display/fire time, not at dispatch time. If the event fires with `days = N` and the type lives in a global that is cleared before then (vote finishers clear their globals in the same execution), every title trigger fails and the event renders blank. Gate delayed events on a per-recipient variable set just before firing, cleared in every option:

```
fire_result_event = {
 set_variable = { my_event_type = global.current_type }
 country_event = { id = foo.1 days = 1 }
}
```

Guard the setter against overwriting a still-pending window (`NOT = { check_variable = { my_event_type > 0 } }`), or a second fire relabels the open event. Events fired with no delay, while the global is guaranteed set for the event's lifetime, may gate on the global directly.

**Caveat:** literal-only effects (`add_timed_idea`, `add_ideas`, `set_country_flag`, event ids) still need an if/else_if type branch inside the shared option. The array-lookup literal wall applies; the branch is the honest form.
