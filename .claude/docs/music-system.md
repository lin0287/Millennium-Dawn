# Music System Reference

How MD organises music and how to add new tracks.

## File types

| Type                 | Location              | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Music definition** | `music/*.asset`       | Maps a logical `song` name to a `.ogg` file  |
| **Playlist**         | `music/*.txt`         | Songs per `music_station` and when they play |
| **Credits**          | `music/*/Credits.txt` | Artist attribution for each station's music  |

## How it works

The game has multiple independent `music_station` channels. At any moment one song is chosen from the active station by weighted chance. Playlists are evaluated continuously, so a song that was unavailable may become eligible as game state changes.

A track must appear in **both** a definition file (declares its audio file) and a playlist file (declares when it plays). Neither alone is sufficient.

## Music definition (`.asset` files)

Each `music = { name = "Song Name" file = "filename.ogg" volume = X }` entry registers the logical name and links it to the physical audio file. These files are NOT Paradox script; they are parsed separately. Every unique `song` name referenced in any `.txt` playlist must have a matching entry in one of the `.asset` files.

- **Name limit:** song IDs cannot exceed 63 characters.
- **Audio format:** `.ogg` (Vorbis). Place the file in the same directory as the `.asset` that references it, or use a relative path from the `music/` root.

Key definition files for MD content:

- `music/MD_music.asset` — Main MD soundtrack (main theme, modern warfare, tension, commercials)
- `music/Main Music/MD_main_music.asset` — Main Music station (EU calm/tension/war tracks by Karel Antonin, Voyager, Matt Ragan, etc.)
- `music/Asian/MD_asian_music.asset` — Asian regional music (calm/tension/war for East Asian countries)
- `music/Middle East/MD_middle_eastern_music.asset` — Middle Eastern regional music (calm/tension/war + jihad nasheeds)
- `music/UKR-RUS war/UKR_RUS_war_music.asset` — Ukraine-Russia war station (UKR and SOV/separatist tracks)
- `music/Synthwave/MD_synthwave.asset` — Synthwave station tracks
- `music/music.asset` — Vanilla base-game soundtrack definitions

## Playlist (`.txt` files)

```
music_station = "Station Name"

music = {
    song = "Logical Song Name"     # must match a name= in an .asset file
    chance = {
        base = N                   # base weight (can be 0)
        modifier = { add = N ... } # trigger-based adjustments
        modifier = { factor = N ... } # multiplier adjustments
    }
}
```

### How chance weights work

The game sums all `base` + `modifier { add = N }` values from every matching modifier. `factor` multiplies the final sum. Higher total weight = more likely selected. Total weight 0 or negative = skipped.

### Common trigger patterns

| Trigger                    | Effect                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `has_war = yes`            | Increases weight during wartime                       |
| `threat > 0.4`             | Increases weight when global threat is high           |
| `original_tag = TAG`       | Increases weight for a specific country               |
| `surrender_progress > 0.5` | Increases weight when a country is losing badly       |
| `has_government = fascism` | Increases weight for specific ideology                |
| `factor = 0`               | Disables the track entirely (0 weight overrides base) |

### Sentinel / separator songs

Some playlists use fake `song` entries with descriptive names (e.g., `"--ASIAN PLAYLIST--"`, `"--UKRAINE PLAYLIST--"`, `"--RUSSIAN PLAYLIST--"`) and `base = 0` or negative weight as visual separators. These never play; they are comments-in-disguise. They still require a matching `name=` in an `.asset` file to avoid parse errors, but the `.asset` entry can point to any valid `.ogg`.

## Music stations in MD

Each entry: station — playlist file; asset file(s); purpose.

- `MD_Soundtrack` — `MD_songs.txt`; `MD_music.asset`; main MD soundtrack — general tension, war, peace, USA-specific tracks, commercials
- `MD_main_music` — playlist inline in asset; `Main Music/MD_main_music.asset`; European-style calm/tension/war tracks
- `MD_regional_music` — `MD_regional_music.txt`; `Asian/MD_asian_music.asset`, `Middle East/MD_middle_eastern_music.asset`; Asian and Middle Eastern regional tracks, triggered by `original_tag`
- `MD_ukrwar_music` — `UKR-RUS war/MD_ukraine_war_music.txt`; `UKR-RUS war/UKR_RUS_war_music.asset`; Ukraine and Russia/separatist war tracks, triggered by `original_tag` + `has_war_with`
- `MD_synthwave_music` — `Synthwave/MD_synthwave.txt`; `Synthwave/MD_synthwave.asset`; always-on synthwave ambient music (equal weight)
- `MD_fm_habibi` — `MD_fm_habibi.txt`; no asset file; Israeli music (currently commented out / disabled)
- `base_music` — `_songs.txt` and integrated-DLC playlists; `music.asset` and game/integrated-DLC assets; vanilla base and integrated-DLC soundtrack

All stations play simultaneously; the game mixes or crossfades between them. Regional stations use `original_tag = TAG` triggers to target specific countries.

### Paid DLC playlists

Do not copy paid-DLC playlist or asset files into MD under their vanilla filenames. Mod files load regardless of DLC ownership, so an override references unavailable song assets and station GUI components for players who do not own that DLC. The engine resolves those references before evaluating `chance`, so a `has_dlc` modifier does not prevent the errors.

Leave paid-DLC music files to the game. Their playlists and assets then load only for owners, while players without the DLC receive no missing-music errors. MD may adapt playlists from integrated DLC because those assets are available to every player.

If a paid-DLC playlist references vanilla scripted triggers or focus IDs removed by an MD `replace_path`, preserve those identifiers in an MD compatibility file. Scripted triggers should retain their vanilla conditions; focus IDs should be registered as unattached shared focuses so they cannot alter any playable tree.

## Adding a new track

### Step 1 — Register in a music definition file

Add to the appropriate `.asset` file:

```
music = { name = "My Song Title" file = "My_Song_Title.ogg" volume = 1.0 }
```

`volume` controls playback loudness relative to other tracks. 1.0 = neutral; above 1.0 amplifies, below 1.0 quiets. Place the `.ogg` in the same directory as the `.asset`.

### Step 2 — Add to a playlist with appropriate triggers

Add to the relevant `.txt` playlist. Choose station and triggers by mood and scope:

- **General soundtrack** (`MD_songs.txt` / `MD_Soundtrack`) — tracks that fit any nation
- **Main music** (`Main Music/`) — European-style calm/tension/war tracks
- **Regional** (`MD_regional_music.txt`) — country-specific regional music (Asian, Middle Eastern)
- **UKR-RUS war** (`UKR-RUS war/MD_ukraine_war_music.txt`) — Ukraine/Russia conflict tracks
- **Synthwave** (`Synthwave/MD_synthwave.txt`) — always-on ambient synthwave
- **Vanilla base** (`_songs.txt` / `base_music`) — base-game or integrated-DLC tracks MD reuses

Example — general peace track:

```
music = {
    song = "My Song Title"
    chance = {
        base = 15
        modifier = { has_war = yes add = -15 }
        modifier = { threat > 0.4 add = -10 }
    }
}
```

Example — war track:

```
music = {
    song = "My War Track"
    chance = {
        base = 0
        modifier = { has_war = yes add = 35 }
        modifier = { surrender_progress > 0.5 add = 20 }
    }
}
```

Example — country-specific regional track:

```
music = {
    song = "My Regional Track"
    chance = {
        base = 0
        modifier = { OR = { original_tag = JAP original_tag = CHI original_tag = KOR } add = 60 }
        modifier = { has_war = yes add = -60 }
    }
}
```

Example — UKR-RUS war track (boosted during active conflict):

```
music = {
    song = "My War Song"
    chance = {
        base = 0
        modifier = { original_tag = UKR add = 1 }
        modifier = {
            OR = { has_war_with = SOV has_war_with = DPR has_war_with = LPR }
            original_tag = UKR
            add = 45
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3 — Update credits (if applicable)

If the track is original or licensed music, add the artist attribution to the `Credits.txt` in the same directory as the `.asset`:

```
# Track Title - Artist Name
```

## Synthwave station

`music/Synthwave/` holds the `MD_synthwave_music` station. It plays all tracks at equal base weight (1) regardless of game state (always-on ambient music). Tracks are defined in `MD_synthwave.asset` and listed in `MD_synthwave.txt`.

To add a synthwave track, add both an `.asset` entry and a playlist entry with `base = 1` and no modifiers.

## Troubleshooting missing music

If a song does not play:

1. **Verify the playlist song name exactly matches the `name=` in the `.asset`** — the lookup is case-sensitive.
2. **Verify the audio file exists and is a valid OGG** — invalid or missing files are silently skipped.
3. **Check the chance weight** — if all modifiers evaluate to 0 or negative, the track is never selected. Try `base = 15` with restrictive modifiers removed to test.
4. **Check the music station** — if the station is not active (e.g., regional trigger not matched), no tracks from it play.
5. **Check the file path** — `.asset` paths are relative to the directory containing the `.asset`, not the `music/` root.

## Radio station GUI

A music station can have an in-game radio faceplate UI. This requires:

1. A `.gui` file in `interface/` defining `containerWindowType` elements for the faceplate (`<station>_faceplate`) and station entry (`<station>_stations_entry`).
2. A sprite definition for the station button's album art in `interface/*.gfx`:
   ```
   spriteType = {
       name = "<SPRITE>"
       texturefile = "gfx/interface/topbar/musicplayer/<FILE NAME>.dds"
       noOfFrames = 2
   }
   ```
3. A localisation entry mapping the station name to display text: `<STATION>:0 "Station Name"`
