- `00_scripted_diplomatic_actions.txt` — Core actions (trade agreements, debt assumption, enforce peace, energy load sharing, embassies, etc.)
- `01_peace_deal_diplomatic_actions.txt` — Peace deal actions

## Scope Rules

In all blocks within a scripted diplomatic action:

| Keyword | Scope                                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ROOT`  | The **sender** (country initiating the action)                                  |
| `THIS`  | The **target** (country receiving the action)                                   |
| `PREV`  | In `visible`/`selectable`, `PREV` inside `ROOT = { }` is `THIS`, and vice versa |

**Important:** `selectable` evaluates in the **target's** scope by default. Bare conditions (no explicit `ROOT = { }`/`THIS = { }`) check `THIS`. Always be explicit about scope.

## Block Order & Structure

```
action_name = {
	allowed = { }          # Game rule / DLC gates — checked once at game start
	visible = { }          # Whether the button appears at all — checked dynamically
	selectable = { }       # Whether the button is clickable (greyed out if false)

	cost = N               # Political power cost
	command_power = N      # Optional command power cost
	icon = N               # Icon index

	requires_acceptance = yes/no
	show_acceptance_on_action_button = yes/no

	send_description = LOC_KEY

	on_sent_effect = { }   # Fires when the player clicks send (before acceptance)
	complete_effect = { }  # Fires on acceptance (or immediately if no acceptance needed)
	reject_effect = { }    # Fires when target rejects

	accept_title = LOC_KEY
	accept_description = LOC_KEY
	reject_title = LOC_KEY
	reject_description = LOC_KEY

	ai_acceptance = { }    # AI weighting for accepting/rejecting
	ai_desire = { }        # AI weighting for initiating the action
}
```

## Cooldown Pattern

Prevent spamming with a timed country flag.

### 1. Set the flag on completion and/or rejection

In `complete_effect` and `reject_effect`, set a timed flag on ROOT (sender) scoped to the target:

```
ROOT = {
	set_country_flag = { flag = recently_did_action_@PREV value = 1 days = 90 }
}
```

- `@PREV` resolves to the target's ID since inside a `ROOT = { }` block PREV = THIS (target).
- `days = 90` is the standard cooldown (adjust per action — e.g., 270 for energy load sharing rejections).
- Set the flag in **both** `complete_effect` and `reject_effect` for a cooldown regardless of outcome.

### 2. Check the flag in `visible`

```
visible = {
	ROOT = { NOT = { has_country_flag = recently_did_action_@PREV } }
	# ... other visibility conditions
}
```

**Why `visible` and not `selectable`?** Dynamic `@PREV`/`@THIS` flag references don't resolve reliably in `selectable`. Use `visible` for cooldown checks.

### 3. Block AI desire during cooldown

In `ai_desire`, add a `factor = 0` modifier:

```
modifier = {
	factor = 0
	ROOT = { has_country_flag = recently_did_action_@PREV }
}
```

## Pending Offer Pattern

Prevent sending the same action to multiple targets at once.

### 1. Set a variable in `on_sent_effect`

```
on_sent_effect = {
	ROOT = { set_variable = { pending_action_offer = PREV.id } }
}
```

### 2. Clear in `complete_effect` and `reject_effect`

```
ROOT = { clear_variable = pending_action_offer }
```

### 3. Block AI in `ai_desire`

```
modifier = {
	factor = 0
	ROOT = { NOT = { check_variable = { pending_action_offer = 0 } } }
}
```

Note: `NOT = { check_variable = { var = 0 } }` means "var is set and non-zero" — the standard idiom for "has a pending offer".

## AI Acceptance Structure

`ai_acceptance` uses named condition blocks, each with a `base` and optional `modifier` entries:

```
ai_acceptance = {
	base_condition_name = {
		base = -25       # Starting disposition
	}
	condition_two = {
		base = 0
		modifier = {
			add = 5
			has_government = ROOT
		}
	}
	# Opinion scaling pattern:
	condition_three = {
		base = 0
		modifier = {
			check_opinion_calculation = yes
			add = opinion_calculator
		}
	}
	# Power ranking comparison blocks (common for coercive actions like enforce peace)
	difference_in_power_ranking = { ... }
}
```

### Mirror Rule (when the action has a custom GUI showing acceptance math)

If your action's scripted GUI shows the player an "AI will accept (+N) / will not accept" breakdown, keep **three** sources in sync. The engine reads `ai_acceptance`; the GUI cannot, so it shows a scripted-trigger calculation that manually mirrors the engine math.

Three updates per new modifier:

1. **Engine math** — `ai_acceptance = { X_factor = { base = N modifier = { ... } } }` in the diplomatic action file.
2. **Mirror calculation** — scripted trigger re-implementing the same logic, accumulating into a temp variable:
   ```
   X_AI_will_accept_calculation = {
       # ...existing components, each accumulating into X_acceptance_temp...
       set_temp_variable = { X_factor_temp = 0 }
       if = {
           limit = { ...same conditions as the engine modifier... }
           set_temp_variable = { X_factor_temp = N }
       }
       add_to_temp_variable = { X_acceptance_temp = X_factor_temp }
   }
   ```
3. **Player breakdown line** — `defined_text` in scripted localisation, plus a loc string and a reference in the headline tooltip key:
   ```
   defined_text = {
       name = X_ai_accept_factor
       text = {
           trigger = { ...same logic, sets X_factor_temp... }
           localization_key = "X_ai_accept_factor_tt"
       }
   }
   # In .yml:
   X_ai_accept_factor_tt: "Factor Name: [?X_factor_temp|0+]\n"
   # In the headline title TT:
   X_AIA_title_TEXT_DELAYED: "Breakdown: ...[X_ai_accept_factor]..."
   ```

Forgetting any of the three causes the player-facing score to diverge silently from the engine score (player sees "will accept (+20)", clicks send, gets rejected). Always-check-three. Concrete examples: CPD's `CPD_AI_will_accept_calculation` (in `00_peace_deal_triggers.txt`) and the `CPD_ai_accept_*` defined_text entries.

## AI Desire Structure

`ai_desire` controls how eagerly the AI initiates. Standard gates:

```
ai_desire = {
	base = N
	# Positive modifiers (faction, opinion, power status)
	modifier = { add = 10  is_in_faction_with = ROOT }
	modifier = { add = 10  is_subject_of = ROOT }

	# Economic gates (graduated)
	modifier = { factor = 0.5  ROOT = { ai_has_minor_economic_problems = yes } }
	modifier = { factor = 0.1  ROOT = { ai_has_moderate_economic_problems = yes } }
	modifier = { factor = 0    ROOT = { ai_has_major_economic_problems = yes } }

	# Hard blocks
	modifier = { factor = 0  ROOT = { has_war = yes } }
	modifier = { factor = 0  ROOT = { NOT = { check_variable = { pending_offer_var = 0 } } } }
	modifier = { factor = 0  ROOT = { has_country_flag = cooldown_flag_@PREV } }
}
```

## Common Selectable Checks

- `embassy_with_root_closed = no` — embassies must be open
- `ERI_is_not_transitional_government = yes` — blocks during Eritrea transitional government
- `has_war_with_or_allies_have_war_with_ROOT = no` — no war between the parties or their allies
- `influence_higher_40 = yes` — ROOT must have 40+ influence on THIS
- Opinion checks: `has_opinion = { target = THIS/ROOT value > N }`

## Logging

Every `on_sent_effect`, `complete_effect`, and `reject_effect` should include a log line:

```
log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: diplomatic action {block_name} {action_name}"
```

## Existing Actions

All require acceptance except `recall_volunteers`, `cancel_trade_agreement`, and
`close_embassy` / `reopen_embassy` (no acceptance needed).
