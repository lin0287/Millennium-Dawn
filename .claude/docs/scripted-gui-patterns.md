# Scripted GUI Patterns

Recurring patterns for data-driven scripted GUIs in MD. Reference implementations: MIO Unlock Catalog (`common/scripted_guis/00_mio_unlock_catalog.txt`) and the EU council (`common/scripted_guis/01_european_union_guis.txt`).

For raw scripted_gui mechanics (context types, parent windows, AI checks), see [`.claude/docs/scripted-gui-rules.md`](./scripted-gui-rules.md). This doc is about the recurring shapes built on top of those primitives.

## Data-driven entries via `dynamic_lists`

When a catalog has N similar entries (votes, MIO unlocks, member states), replace N hardcoded `containerWindowType` blocks with one `entry_container` template + a `gridboxType` driven by `dynamic_lists`. Hidden entries are simply absent from the backing array — no `_visible` games on nested containers (which silently fail anyway).

### Backing array

Holds integer entry IDs (1..N), not tokens. EU votes use the vote ID directly; MIO catalog uses 1..23 mapped to a parallel `global.mio_catalog_all_tokens` master array. Because the IDs are 1-based but `add_to_array` is 0-based, the token array reserves a never-read index-0 slot so `array^v` lines up (otherwise every `^v` lookup is shifted by one — the cause of issue #1955).

```
add_to_array = { mio_catalog_visible_array = 1 }
add_to_array = { mio_catalog_visible_array = 2 }
```

### GUI side

```
gridboxType = {
    name = "mio_catalog_grid"
    position = { x = @entryx y = 5 }
    size = { width = @entryw height = 100%% }
    slotsize = { width = @entryw height = 100 }
    format = "UPPER_LEFT"
    max_slots_horizontal = 1
}

containerWindowType = {
    name = "mio_catalog_entry_container"
    # ...one entry's worth of buttonType / iconType / instantTextboxType
}
```

Note `100%%` — gridboxType requires double `%` for percentage sizes.

### Scripted_gui side

```
dynamic_lists = {
    mio_catalog_grid = {
        array = mio_catalog_visible_array
        entry_container = "mio_catalog_entry_container"
        # value = v, index = i, change_scope = no — all defaults
    }
}
```

`v` is the loop variable (default name; rarely worth renaming). Inside trigger / effect / property / scripted-loc evaluation, `v` holds the current entry's array value. EU votes use it as a vote ID; MIO uses it as a 1..23 entry index.

### Element-name reuse

Each entry container is instantiated N times, but the scripted_gui writes only one set of `_click_enabled` / `_visible` / `_click` blocks. The engine evaluates them once per entry, with `v` set to that entry's value. So `mio_cat_unlock_btn_click_enabled` runs 23 times per refresh (once per visible entry), each with `v` set to that entry's ID.

## Per-entry display via scripted-localisation dispatchers

Per-entry data (name, icon, tooltip) lives in `defined_text` blocks keyed on `v`. The GUI references the dispatcher by name; it returns the right loc key per entry.

```
defined_text = {
    name = mio_catalog_entry_name
    text = { trigger = { check_variable = { v = 1 } }   localization_key = GENERIC_krepost_state_defense_bureau_name }
    text = { trigger = { check_variable = { v = 2 } }   localization_key = GENERIC_north_plains_heavy_industries_name }
    # ...
}
```

Reference in the entry container:

```
instantTextboxType = {
    name = "name"
    text = "[mio_catalog_entry_name]"
}
```

### Where scripted-loc invocation works

Each attribute below takes a `= "[scripted_loc]"` value.

| Attribute             | Works      | Notes                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`                | yes        | `instantTextboxType.text`, also `buttonText`              |
| `pdx_tooltip`         | yes        | Precedent: `interface/eu.gui`                             |
| `pdx_tooltip_delayed` | use direct | Don't wrap through a static YAML key — `v` scope may drop |
| `image`               | yes        | Sprite name from scripted-loc; in `properties` block      |

### What scripted-loc dispatch can't do

- Return a loc key whose value contains `[!trigger_name]` and have the `[!]` re-evaluate. The engine substitutes the dispatched loc value as raw text. Put `[!]` directly in the same flat loc value as your scripted-loc call, not chained through a dispatcher.
- Compute or transform — only branch on `check_variable` (or other triggers) and return a static `localization_key`. For runtime string construction, use `meta_trigger`/`meta_effect` instead (see [`meta-effect-patterns.md`](meta-effect-patterns.md)).

### Dispatcher size economics

23 entries × 5 fields (name, trait, equip label, icon, desc) = 115 `defined_text` branches. Verbose, but every branch is one line; the alternative is 23 entry-container copies with 5 hardcoded fields each (~30 lines per copy = 690 lines). Net win once you have ~6+ entries.

### When the dispatcher explodes — gridbox over an array of scopes

The single-`v` dispatcher only scales in **one** dimension. The moment the display is an **entity × category matrix** — and especially when the entity axis is a _runtime-variable set_ — branch count becomes N×M and the dispatcher is the wrong tool.

The EU Parliament member breakdown was the cautionary case: "which countries hold seats in political group N, and how many" is `tags × 24 groups`. It had been built as **1,536 `TAG_party_N_PG` `defined_text` blocks + 1,536 backing loc strings**, concatenated into 24 per-group tokens and shown in a hover tooltip (tooltips can't host a gridbox, which forced the concatenation). Every new EU member meant hand-writing 24 more blocks + 24 loc keys + editing 24 concatenations.

The fix is to stop enumerating and **render from data**: a `gridboxType` over a backing array of **scope objects** (not integer IDs), with `change_scope = yes` so each row scopes _into_ the country and reads generic getters. No per-entity loc, no per-entity GUI.

```
# Effect: rebuild the array for the selected category (loops the member array)
EU_select_party_members = {
    clear_array = global.EU_MEP_members_current
    set_temp_variable = { sel_party = global.EU_selected_party }
    for_each_scope_loop = {
        array = global.EU_member
        meta_effect = {
            text = {
                if = {
                    limit = { check_variable = { THIS.MEP_party_[sp] > 0 } }
                    set_variable = { THIS.MEP_party_selected_display = THIS.MEP_party_[sp] }
                    add_to_array = { global.EU_MEP_members_current = THIS }
                }
            }
            sp = "[?sel_party]"
        }
    }
}
```

```
# Scripted_gui: one gridbox, scope-changing
dynamic_lists = {
    eu_party_members_list = {
        array = global.EU_MEP_members_current
        entry_container = "eu_party_member_detail"
        change_scope = yes
    }
}
```

```
# Entry container: generic getters + a per-scope variable — zero per-entity content
instantTextBoxType = { name = "..._tag"   text = "[?THIS.GetNameWithFlag]" }
instantTextBoxType = { name = "..._seats" text = "[?THIS.MEP_party_selected_display]" }
```

This replaced 3,072 hand-written lines with one effect + one gridbox + one entry container.

**Rules of thumb:**

- One dimension, fixed entry set → scripted-loc dispatcher on `v` (above).
- Two dimensions, or an entity set that grows when content is added → gridbox over an array of scopes with `change_scope = yes`; read per-scope variables, never enumerate.
- A gridbox can't live in a tooltip. If the data is currently in a hover tooltip and needs a real list, move it into a window/side panel first (a click handler that sets a selector variable + flag, then bumps the dirty var).

### Adding a new entity must cost nothing

The payoff test for a data-driven display: **adding one more entity should require no localisation or GUI edits.** For the EU, adding a member nation now needs only the standard join (gain the `EU_member` idea, land in `global.EU_member`) and a valid domestic party setup so the parliament election assigns it seats — the breakdown picks it up automatically because every loop iterates `global.EU_member` and every row renders through generic getters. If a new entity still forces you to hand-write per-entity blocks, the display is still enumerated, not data-driven.

EU parliament reference implementation:

- Populate effect: `EU_select_party_members` — `common/scripted_effects/99_eu_scripted_effects.txt`
- Selector + open handler: `eu_view_party_N_members_click` — `common/scripted_guis/01_european_union_guis.txt`
- Gridbox scripted_gui: `eu_party_member_detail_gui` — same file
- Window + entry container: `eu_party_member_detail_container` / `eu_party_member_detail` — `interface/eu.gui`
- Per-scope data: `THIS.MEP_party_0..23`, `THIS.MEP_Total`; aggregates `global.MEP_PG_party_N`
- Entity set: `global.EU_member`

## Dirty variable — MD standard

GUIs with `dirty = global.X` only refresh when X's value changes. Use this to avoid per-tick re-evaluation of expensive triggers / scripted-loc.

### Standard scripted-effect shape

```
update_<system>_dirty_variable = {
    if = { limit = { check_variable = { global.<system>_dirty_update_var < 10000 } }
        add_to_variable = { global.<system>_dirty_update_var = 1 }
    }
    else = {
        set_variable = { global.<system>_dirty_update_var = 1 }
    }
}
```

The else branch rolls over before integer overflow. Threshold is typically 10000 (NATO, MIO catalog) or 1000000 (ledger). Pick something well above the realistic player-action count.

References:

- `common/scripted_effects/00_ledger_scripted_effects.txt:282` (`update_ledger_dirty_var`, 1M threshold)
- `common/scripted_effects/01_NATO_effects.txt:2` (`update_nato_dirty_variable`, 10K threshold)
- `common/scripted_effects/00_mio_scripted_effects.txt` (`update_mio_catalog_dirty_variable`, 10K)

### Variable naming convention

`global.<system>_dirty_update_var` (NATO, MIO) or `global.<system>_ui_dirty_var` (ledger). Either is acceptable — pick one per system and use it everywhere.

### Call from every state-changing effect

Every click handler / state-toggling effect in the scripted*gui should end with `update*<system>\_dirty_variable = yes`. Including the close/toggle-off paths, not just the open path. For the player-only `is_ai = no` guard rule (and when call sites need it), see the dirty-variable section of [`scripted-gui-rules.md`](./scripted-gui-rules.md).

## Filter checkbox — image swap, not frame swap

`GFX_generic_checkbox` is a single-frame sprite. The `_frame` trigger pattern silently fails on it (renders as nothing on the "checked" frame). Use two separate sprites swapped via a scripted-loc and the GUI's `properties` block.

```
# Scripted-loc
defined_text = {
    name = mio_catalog_filter_toggle_icon
    text = {
        trigger = { has_country_flag = mio_catalog_filter_available }
        localization_key = GFX_generic_checkbox_checked
    }
    text = {
        localization_key = GFX_generic_checkbox_open
    }
}

# Scripted_gui properties
properties = {
    mio_catalog_filter_toggle_btn = {
        image = "[mio_catalog_filter_toggle_icon]"
    }
}

# GUI buttonType — default sprite is the "off" state; properties overrides per-frame
buttonType = {
    name = "mio_catalog_filter_toggle_btn"
    spriteType = "GFX_generic_checkbox_open"
    clicksound = click_checkbox
}
```

Reference implementation: `mio_catalog_filter_toggle_btn` — scripted-loc `mio_catalog_filter_toggle_icon` in `common/scripted_localisation/00_mio_catalog_scripted_loc.txt`, properties swap in `common/scripted_guis/00_mio_unlock_catalog.txt`, button in `interface/military_industrial_organization/zz_mio_unlock_catalog.gui`. The `GFX_generic_checkbox_open` / `GFX_generic_checkbox_checked` sprites are defined in `interface/countryconstructionsview.gfx`.

## Per-entry tooltip with dynamic per-MIO ✓/✗ icons

Standard `[!trigger]` rendering shows each subcondition with a green/red icon. To make it per-entry (different requirements per MIO/vote/etc), put `[!]` on a static-name outer trigger that uses `meta_trigger` to forward into the per-entity check.

```yaml
MIO_CAT_UNLOCK_BTN_REQUIREMENTS_TT: "[!mio_catalog_entry_prereqs_yes]"
```

```
mio_catalog_entry_prereqs_yes = {
    meta_trigger = {
        text = { [TRIG] = yes }
        TRIG = "[?global.mio_catalog_all_tokens^v.GetTokenKey]_unlock_btn_enabled"
    }
}
```

See [`meta-effect-patterns.md`](meta-effect-patterns.md) for the meta_trigger mechanics and why this is the only way to keep `[!]` rendering working with per-entry dispatch.

## Visibility rule of thumb

`visible` on the scripted_gui's `window_name` works fine. `_visible` triggers on **nested** `containerWindowType` elements (entries inside a scrollable parent) silently fail to hide them — there is no working precedent in MD. Always use array filtering instead: rebuild the visible array to exclude entries that shouldn't show. Hiding individual button/icon/textbox elements within a rendered entry **does** work via `_visible`; only the wrapping containerWindowType is the broken case.

## State that needs to persist across saves

`set_country_flag` and `set_global_flag` persist with the save. Variables persist if `set_variable` (not `set_temp_variable`). Master arrays seeded once at game start — put them in `setup_global_arrays` (`common/scripted_effects/00_startup_effects.txt`) so the master is populated for every save without lazy-seeding logic. Per-country derived arrays should be rebuilt on demand via the scripted_gui's `effects`, not stored in the save (cheap to rebuild, expensive to bloat the save).

For initial AI population — call your `rebuild_*_yes` effect inside `every_country = { ... }` at the bottom of `setup_global_arrays` so every AI starts with the array populated. Without that, AI never triggers a click that would build it.
