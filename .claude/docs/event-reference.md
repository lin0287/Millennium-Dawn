# Event Reference

Event conventions, structure, examples, and dispatch patterns.

## Authoring Rules

- Use `is_triggered_only = yes` and wire the caller. MTTH weight modifiers in
  `random_events` pools are a separate mechanism, described below.
- Match every ID to the file's declared namespace and every option log to its own ID.
  `tools/linting/fix_log_ids.py` can fix copied log IDs on scoped files.
- Only news events use `major = yes`. Fire one broadcast, never one per country
  through `every_country` or `every_other_country`.
- Pure notifications use `minor_flavor = yes`. Batch repeated deliveries as described below.
- Resolve pictures against MD's `interface/*.gfx`, not vanilla event art. Check that
  the texture exists and fits the window before using the sprite.
- Raw `add_building_construction` for `naval_base` requires a `province`.
  Building scripted effects charge treasury internally; do not charge twice.
- New party entries also need the hooks in [Party Localisation](party-loc-reference.md).

In every example below, replace `TAG`, `tag_ns`, and the namespace number with your event's values. `tag_ns` is whatever the file declared via `add_namespace = ...` at the top.

## Example: Basic Triggered Event

```
country_event = {
 id = tag_ns.N
 title = tag_ns.N.t
 desc = tag_ns.N.d
 picture = GFX_some_picture
 is_triggered_only = yes

 option = {
  name = tag_ns.N.a
  log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: tag_ns.N.a executed"
  set_temp_variable = { party_popularity_increase = -0.01 }
  change_relative_party_popularity = yes

  ai_chance = { base = 1 }
 }

 option = {
  name = tag_ns.N.b
  ai_chance = { base = 0 }
 }
}
```

## Example: Per-Option Log Messages

Each option's log must match its own ID — copy-paste errors between `.a` and `.b` (or `.b` and `.c`) are common:

```
 option = {
  name = tag_ns.N.a
  log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: tag_ns.N.a executed"  # .a not .b
  add_political_power = 25
 }
 option = {
  name = tag_ns.N.b
  log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: tag_ns.N.b executed"  # .b not .a
  add_stability = -0.02
 }
```

Only an option that runs effects gets a log — a dismiss option carrying nothing but `name`, `trigger` and `ai_chance` logs a state change that never happened, and `validate_events` reports it as `event-option-log-without-effect`.

## Example: Multi-Option Cross-Country Event

When an event fires to a different country than the one that initiated the action, AI weighting must reflect that country's situation (opinion, influence, ideology), never base-only random chance. Here `SNDR` is the sender (whoever fired the event) and the receiver is the current scope (`This`):

```
country_event = {
 id = tag_ns.N
 title = tag_ns.N.t
 desc = tag_ns.N.d
 picture = GFX_some_picture
 is_triggered_only = yes
 trigger = {
  original_tag = TAG   # narrow to receiver if needed
 }

 option = { # reject
  name = tag_ns.N.a
  log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: tag_ns.N.a executed"
  # rejection effects...
  SNDR = { country_event = { id = tag_ns.M days = 1 } }   # tell sender we rejected
  ai_chance = {
   base = 15
   modifier = {
    factor = 0
    sender_influence_higher_30 = yes
   }
   modifier = {
    add = 10
    has_opinion = { target = SNDR value < -15 }
   }
  }
 }

 option = { # accept
  name = tag_ns.N.b
  log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: tag_ns.N.b executed"
  # acceptance effects...
  SNDR = { country_event = { id = tag_ns.K days = 1 } }   # tell sender we accepted
  ai_chance = {
   base = 0
   modifier = {
    add = 5
    factor = 2
    sender_influence_higher_5 = yes
   }
  }
 }
}
```

## Historical Events (ETD System)

Trigger date-based events via `common/scripted_effects/00_yearly_effects.txt`:

```
# First year events
MD_event_on_startup_events = {
 CAM = { country_event = { id = Cameroon.1 days = 50 random_days = 50 } }
}

# Specific year events
trigger_year_2067_events = {
 USA = { country_event = { id = collapse_event.1 days = 30 random_days = 336 } }
}
```

When the intended recipient may no longer own the target state, use the owner-guard pattern (check expected owner, fall back to `random_country = { limit = { owns_state = X } }`).

An event whose own `trigger` carries a `date > YYYY.M.D` lower bound must have a scheduling entry here; the guard only blocks an early fire, it never causes one. `validate_events.py` enforces this (`date-gated-not-scheduled`); a chain event fired by an already-scheduled parent inherits its schedule and needs no entry of its own.

## Treasury/Debt/Productivity Effects

Commonly used in event options:

```
# Modify treasury
set_temp_variable = { treasury_change = -10.00 }
modify_treasury_effect = yes

# Preset expenditures
small_expenditure = yes    # medium_expenditure, large_expenditure

# Modify debt
set_temp_variable = { debt_change = 0.1 }
modify_debt_effect = yes

# Adjust productivity
set_temp_variable = { temp_productivity_change = 0.025 }
flat_productivity_change_effect = yes
```

## News Events

News events use `news_event` (not `country_event`) and `major = yes` so all countries see them. Separate the namespace from the parent events (e.g., `add_namespace = my_news` alongside `add_namespace = my_events`).

Use option `trigger` blocks to give different response text to involved parties, regional neighbors, and the rest of the world. Every country must match exactly one option — ensure trigger conditions are exhaustive and mutually exclusive.

```
news_event = {
 id = my_news.1
 title = my_news.1.t
 desc = my_news.1.d
 picture = GFX_some_picture
 major = yes
 is_triggered_only = yes

 option = {
  name = my_news.1.a
  trigger = { original_tag = TAG }
 }
 option = {
  name = my_news.1.b
  trigger = {
   NOT = { original_tag = TAG }
   capital_scope = { is_on_continent = CONTINENT }
  }
 }
 option = {
  name = my_news.1.c
  trigger = {
   NOT = { original_tag = TAG }
   NOT = { capital_scope = { is_on_continent = CONTINENT } }
  }
 }
}
```

### Picture format

A news event's picture is a different shape from a country event's, and each window draws its picture at the texture's native size, so the wrong one overflows the frame or leaves a gap. News art is wide (`397x153` dominant, `400x150` and `500x250` also in use); country art is nearly square (`217x163` dominant). Sprite names do not tell them apart — `GFX_china_trade_war` is news art and `GFX_FRA_eiffel_tower_news` is not — so check the texture before reusing a picture across the two event types. `validate_events` → `event-picture-format-mismatch` (ERROR) reports a swap and fails CI.

A `hidden = yes` event opens no window, so a `picture` on one is dead data and is reported as `hidden-event-picture`.

`GFX_placeholder_events`, `GFX_placeholder_news` and `GFX_news_md4` are drafting stand-ins, not shippable art. Any event pointing at one is reported as `placeholder-event-picture` (ERROR).

## Conditional Descriptions

Use `text =` inside desc blocks for conditional descriptions, **not** `desc =`:

```
# Correct
desc = {
 text = my_event.d_variant_a
 trigger = { has_global_flag = chose_option_a }
}

# Wrong — causes "Unexpected token: desc" error
desc = {
 desc = my_event.d_variant_a
 trigger = { has_global_flag = chose_option_a }
}
```

## Cross-Country Event Chains

When firing follow-up events to other countries, wrap in `hidden_effect` so chain consequences don't appear in the firing option's tooltip:

```
option = {
 name = my_event.a
 add_war_support = 0.05
 hidden_effect = {
  OTHER = { country_event = { id = my_event.2 days = 1 } }
  news_event = { id = my_news.1 days = 1 }
 }
 ai_chance = { base = 80 }
}
```

## Cross-Country Event Tooltips

When a focus `completion_reward` or event option fires an event to another country, add `custom_effect_tooltip = TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT` immediately after the fire, then `effect_tooltip = { ... }` showing the acceptance outcome:

```
OTHER = { country_event = { id = tag_ns.N days = 1 } }
custom_effect_tooltip = TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT
effect_tooltip = { custom_effect_tooltip = TAG_deal_signed_tt }
```

Add `TT_IF_THEY_REJECT` + its own `effect_tooltip` **only** when rejection has real sender-side consequences (opinion penalty, retaliation, tariff, follow-up chain). If rejection just means "nothing happens," omit it — never write an empty reject block. When both branches have real outcomes, include both:

```
OTHER = { country_event = { id = tag_ns.N days = 1 } }
custom_effect_tooltip = TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT
effect_tooltip = { custom_effect_tooltip = TAG_deal_signed_tt }
custom_effect_tooltip = TT_IF_THEY_REJECT
effect_tooltip = { custom_effect_tooltip = TAG_sanctions_response_tt }
```

Inside the **target's** event options, use `TT_IF_WE_ACCEPT` / `TT_IF_WE_DECLINE` the same way to preview each response's consequences for the responder.

Keys are defined in `localisation/english/MD_tooltips_l_english.yml`:

- `TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT` / `TT_IF_THEY_REJECT` — outcomes of YOUR action firing to THEM
- `TT_IF_WE_ACCEPT` / `TT_IF_WE_DECLINE` — inside the target's event option

## `random_events` Dispatch (on_actions)

Events registered inside an `on_actions` `random_events = { … }` block are picked by **weighted roll against the `0 = N` "nothing happens" slot**, not by MTTH alone:

```
random_events = {
    2500 = 0          # weight assigned to "no event fires" this tick
    100 = brotherhood.6
    100 = brotherhood.7
}
```

- A single roll runs each tick the parent `on_action` fires. Each candidate's chance is `weight / sum_of_weights`. The `0` slot exists so most ticks produce nothing.
- `is_triggered_only = yes` events selected this way still check their own `trigger = { … }` block. If the trigger fails on the rolled country, **nothing fires that tick** — the roll does not retry. Tight triggers thin out effective fire rates a lot.
- **`mean_time_to_happen` is NOT dead inside `random_events`**: the engine multiplies the candidate's effective weight by the MTTH `factor` modifiers that match the rolled scope. This lets you globally register an event but still tune per-country pacing via MTTH modifier blocks (e.g., "fire 1.5× more often when `neutrality > 0.40`"). Keep MTTH blocks on events listed in `random_events` whenever you want per-country weight tuning.
- Prefer `random_events` over hand-rolled `random_list` inside on_action effects for systems that should fire across many countries — cheaper than iterating arrays and adds a uniform global cadence.

## Batched Notification Events

When many sources deliver the same kind of thing to one country (NATO aid to Ukraine, coalition funding, aid convoys), don't fire one event per delivery. Accumulate into per-category variables at the delivery site and fire a single batched report. Worked example: `UKR_queue_nato_aid_report` in `common/scripted_effects/99_UKR_scripted_effects.txt`, reported by `ukraine_nato_help.1`.

Four rules make the batch safe:

- **Never put the payload in the report.** Grant the money, equipment, or modifier at the delivery site. The event is a summary and nothing else. If the payload lives in the event option, a report lost to annexation, tag change, or a stuck flag loses the payload with it, and the delivery-site tooltip goes silent because `add_to_variable` renders nothing.
- **Time the "report pending" flag.** `set_country_flag = { flag = X_report_pending days = N+1 value = 1 }` where the event fires at `days = N`. An untimed flag that only clears in the event option wedges the whole system permanently the first time an event is dropped, and every later delivery goes unreported forever.
- **Skip the event for AI owners.** Guard on `is_ai = yes` and clear the accumulators instead of firing. Saves a popup resolution per window and keeps the variables from growing on AI games.
- **`minor_flavor = yes`** on the report event so it lands as a corner notification rather than a blocking popup. Reports fire on a cadence, and a full popup every window is what makes the system feel spammy.

## Reuse Effect Tooltips Instead of Writing New Loc

`effect_tooltip = { <the real effect> }` renders vanilla's own tooltip for an effect without executing it. Prefer it over hand-written `custom_effect_tooltip` keys whenever the thing you want to describe is an effect the engine already localises:

```
# Good — no new loc key, equipment names come from vanilla
effect_tooltip = { add_equipment_to_stockpile = { type = infantry_weapons_type amount = UKR_aid_report_infantry } }

# Avoid — a new key per category that has to be kept in sync by hand
custom_effect_tooltip = UKR_aid_report_infantry_tt
```

`amount` accepts a variable, so a report can render live totals. A `hidden_effect` setter is not visible to a following `effect_tooltip`, so when a scripted effect's tooltip reads a temp var, either set that var at effect level (accepting one blank line, as every other MD caller does) or write a small loc key that reads the persistent variable directly. Reserve `custom_effect_tooltip` for things with no effect behind them.

## Content Guidelines for Events

- All events targeting another nation need AI weighting based on opinion/influence
- Aim for 10-15 flavour events per country — gameplay should not be "click focus, wait"
- Cross-nation permanent effects should come from events (give target player agency)
- Use `is_triggered_only = yes` for all triggered events — never open-fire MTTH events
