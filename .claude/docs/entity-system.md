# Entity & 3D Model System

How HOI4 links unit/equipment script objects to 3D models, and how Millennium Dawn organises that data.

## The mesh → entity → animation chain

Three layers, all under `gfx/`:

| Layer     | File                    | Block       |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Mesh      | `gfx/entities/*.gfx`    | `pdxmesh`   |
| Entity    | `gfx/entities/*.asset`  | `entity`    |
| Animation | `gfx/models/**/*.asset` | `animation` |

Each block defines:

- `pdxmesh` — `name`, `file` (path to a `.mesh`), `animation` id→type bindings, `scale`
- `entity` — `name`, `pdxmesh`, `state`, `attach`, `locator`, `scale`, `cull_radius`, `default_state`
- `animation` — `name`, `file` (path to a `.anim`)

In `entity`, `state` holds animation states and `attach` sub-entities.

An `entity` references a `pdxmesh` by name; a `pdxmesh` references a `.mesh` file and binds animation ids; an `animation` id resolves to a `.anim` file. An entity may `attach` other entities (a soldier attaches weapon entities, a vehicle attaches its crew, etc.).

## How a unit gets its 3D model — the three-level lookup

The engine builds an entity name from a **prefix** plus a **suffix** and resolves it through three levels, first hit wins:

1. `<TAG>_<suffix>_entity` — country-specific override
2. `<graphical_culture>_<suffix>_entity` — culture-shared
3. `<suffix>_entity` — generic fallback

`graphical_culture` is set per country in `common/countries/<Country>.txt`; valid values are listed in `common/graphicalculturetype.txt`. **The `graphical_culture` value doubles as an entity-name prefix** — vanilla ships `asian_gfx_infantry_entity`, `southamerican_gfx_infantry_entity`, `commonwealth_gfx_infantry_entity`, etc.

Consequence: a group of tags can share **one** bespoke entity set by sharing a `graphical_culture` and defining a single `<graphical_culture>_*` set — no per-tag copies. In MD, 332 of 391 tags have no bespoke entity file and resolve straight to the generic `<suffix>_entity` set.

## Naming convention

```
[<prefix>_]<suffix>_entity[_<terrain>]
```

- `prefix` — a country `TAG`, a `graphical_culture`, or omitted (generic).
- `suffix` — identifies the unit/equipment (sub-unit + equipment model level).
- `terrain` — optional `desert` / `snow` variant.

## File organisation in `gfx/entities/`

Entity files (`.asset`) define `entity` blocks; pdxmesh files (`.gfx`) define `pdxmesh` blocks in `objectTypes = { }`.

### Shared pdxmesh files

`.gfx` rows hold shared pdxmesh definitions; `.asset` rows hold generic entity sets.

| File                           | Contains                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `infantry.gfx`                 | Infantry (fallback variants for generic infantry) |
| `MD_vehicles.gfx`              | Vehicles                                          |
| `MD_smallarms.gfx`             | Small arms                                        |
| `MD_ships.gfx`                 | Ships                                             |
| `MD_buildings.gfx`             | Buildings                                         |
| `MD_units_planes.asset`        | Generic plane entity sets                         |
| `MD_units_ships.asset`         | Generic ship entity sets                          |
| `___MD_planes.gfx`             | Additional shared plane pdxmeshes                 |
| `___MD_tanks_and_vehicles.gfx` | Additional shared tank/vehicle pdxmeshes          |

Pdxmesh naming follows the `MD_` prefix convention (e.g., `MD_mechanized`, `MD_infantry_2`). Historical files may still reference the older `MD4_` prefix — both are valid but new definitions should use `MD_`.

### Per-country files

- `<TAG>_MD_infantryandvehicle.asset` / `.gfx` — per-country infantry/vehicle entity sets and associated pdxmesh definitions (~59 tags have one).
- `<TAG>_MD_planes.asset` — per-country plane entity sets (SOV, USA, JAP, GER, etc.).
- `<TAG>_MD_tanks.asset` / `*_tanks.asset` — per-country tank entity sets.
- `<TAG>_MD_ships.asset` — per-country ship entity sets.
- `northamerican_gfx_infantryandvehicle.asset` — a culture-shared set serving all US-balkanization breakaway nations at once.

Shared weapon/accessory entities (`*_weapon_*_entity`, `cigarette_entity`, vehicle entities) are `attach`ed by soldier entities and referenced across many files.

## The division designer model selector (performance note)

The 3D model selector in the division designer (`interface/divisiondesignerview.gui`, window `div_template_select_model`, gridbox `buttons_grid`) is **engine-native** — no scripted GUI, no `dynamic_lists`, no `dirty` variable. The engine enumerates unit entities to build the list, so total entity count drives how heavy it is to open. MD ships ~25,000 entities versus vanilla's ~575.

**Do not copy a unit entity set once per country tag.** If several tags should share a bespoke look, give them the same `graphical_culture` and define one `<graphical_culture>_*` set; the engine's culture-level lookup serves all of them. (The US breakaways were once 17 byte-identical per-tag copies — 4,760 entities — later consolidated into a single 280-entity `northamerican_gfx_*` set.)

## Landmark buildings (state-placed 3D models)

Landmarks (Big Ben, Statue of Liberty, Mt. Fuji, etc.) use the same mesh/entity chain plus two more layers: a **state-file placement** and a **map spawn point**. Both must agree on which province the landmark sits in, or the icon shows in the state UI while the 3D model never renders. Most rendering bugs are at this layer, not in the asset chain.

### Five files per landmark

- `common/buildings/01_landmark_buildings.txt` — `landmark_<name> = { spawn_point = landmark_spawn ... }`: building definition (DLC gate, modifiers, icon, scale cap, `enable_for_controllers`).
- `gfx/entities/landmarks.asset` — `entity = { name = "building_landmark_<name>" pdxmesh = "..." }`: entity definition + scale + destruction animation states.
- `gfx/entities/landmarks.gfx` — `pdxmesh = { name = "landmark_<name>_mesh" file = "..." }`: mesh-name → `.mesh` file mapping.
- `history/states/<id>-<Name>.txt` — inside `buildings = { <PROVINCE_ID> = { landmark_<name> = { level = 1 } } }`: per-state placement of the landmark in a specific province.
- `map/buildings.txt` — `<state_id>;landmark_spawn;<x>;<y>;<z>;<rot>;<province_id>`: world-space spawn coordinates used to render the model.

If any is missing or inconsistent, the building either silently fails to render or errors in `error.log` (`mapbuildings.cpp:679: ... not over the land - ignoring instance`).

### Validating a spawn point against the province bitmap

The engine determines which province a spawn sits in from `(x, z)` against `map/provinces.bmp`. The trailing province-id field on a `landmark_spawn` line is the explicit binding hint — it must match the province `provinces.bmp` reports at those coordinates and the province the state file places the landmark in. **All three must agree**, or rendering silently fails.

Pixel-to-world: `world_x == pixel_x`, `world_z == (height - 1) - pixel_y`. Map is 5632×2048. Province colors come from `map/definition.csv`.

Audit script template (used to fix the entire landmark roster during the 2026-05 restoration):

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np, csv

arr = np.array(Image.open('map/provinces.bmp')); H, W, _ = arr.shape
hmap = np.array(Image.open('map/heightmap.bmp').convert('L'))
color_to_pid = {}
with open('map/definition.csv', encoding='latin-1') as f:
    for r in csv.reader(f, delimiter=';'):
        if r and r[0].isdigit():
            color_to_pid[(int(r[1]), int(r[2]), int(r[3]))] = int(r[0])

def prov_at(x, z):
    px, py = int(round(x)), (H-1) - int(round(z))
    return color_to_pid.get(tuple(arr[py, px].tolist()))

def heightmap_at(x, z):
    return int(hmap[(H-1) - int(z), int(x)])
```

To find a known-good spawn for a province ID, take the centroid of an _eroded_ mask (interior pixels only) so the spawn isn't on a province border.

### Y-coordinate calibration from the heightmap

`map/heightmap.bmp` is single-channel where sea level ≈ 95. The `y` on a `landmark_spawn` line must sit just above the terrain at that XZ. Empirical fit across 15 working landmarks: `y ≈ 0.1017 × heightmap + 0.06 + 0.3 clearance`.

Anchoring examples:

- Big Ben at (2802, 1551): heightmap 98 → y = 10.30 (terrain ~10.03, clearance 0.27)
- Mt. Fuji at (4968, 1243): heightmap 124 → y = 12.40
- Bojnice Castle at (3098, 1502): heightmap 141 → y = 14.70

If `y` is well below terrain, the engine accepts the line but the model renders underground (invisible from above). If too far above, it floats. **Aim for heightmap-derived y + ~0.3 clearance.**

### Common gotchas

1. **"not over the land" in error.log** = the spawn's `(x, z)` falls in a sea-province pixel. The trailing `province_id` doesn't help; XZ must be a land tile. Float harbours sit in sea provinces — their coordinates are _not_ valid landmark spawns.

2. **Co-occupancy with `naval_base` in the same province block** breaks landmark rendering. The Statue of Liberty pattern (one landmark in its own dedicated province block, nothing else) reliably works; combining a landmark with `naval_base = N` in the same block does not. Workaround: move the other building to a different province in the state, or split blocks.

3. **Map reworks silently drop `landmark_spawn` lines.** Commits 89ccbf62cc (#725) and 4da960e3c8 (#810) regenerated `map/buildings.txt` without preserving existing landmark spawn entries. When auditing, `git log -S "<state_id>;landmark_spawn" -- map/buildings.txt` tells you whether a spawn existed historically.

4. **Same filename = vanilla file is replaced.** MD's `landmarks.gfx` / `landmarks.asset` / `01_landmark_buildings.txt` override vanilla's at the file level (none of those paths are in `descriptor.mod`'s `replace_path` list, but file-level shadowing applies regardless). When adding a vanilla landmark to MD, the entity, mesh, and building definitions must be **copied into MD's files** — they won't merge from vanilla. Mesh **binaries** (`.mesh`, `.dds`, `.anim`) under `gfx/models/buildings/landmarks/` use path-based fallback, so MD needn't ship copies when vanilla's bytes are correct.

5. **`enable_for_controllers` gating.** Removing it follows the Mecca pattern: any controller of the state gets the modifier (good for tourism / heritage). Keeping it gates the modifier to the home country only (good for strategic/military buildings like ICBM silos where a foreign occupier shouldn't benefit).

6. **`show_on_map = 0`** means no 3D model is drawn even if a spawn exists. The Binnenhof landmark uses this — intentionally state-UI-only.

### Quick troubleshooting flow

When a landmark shows the icon in the state UI but no 3D model appears:

1. Grep `map/buildings.txt` for the state's `landmark_spawn` line. If missing, that's the bug.
2. Run `prov_at(x, z)` against the spawn's XZ. Confirm it equals the province in the state file. If not, recompute the centroid of the placement province and update the spawn.
3. Check `error.log` for `mapbuildings.cpp:679` — "not over the land" means XZ is sea, move it.
4. Confirm the building's `dlc_allowed` matches the installed DLC (`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Hearts of Iron IV/dlc/`).
5. Verify the building's province block in the state file doesn't share with `naval_base` (the Big Ben gotcha).
6. Confirm the entity + mesh definitions exist in MD's `landmarks.asset` / `landmarks.gfx` (file-level override means vanilla's aren't loaded).
