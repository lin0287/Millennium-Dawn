# Focus Tree Reference

Focus tree conventions, structure, property order, and examples.

## Authoring Rules

- IDs use `TAG_focus_name`. Use `relative_position_id` beyond the root.
- Include logging, `ai_will_do = { base = N }`, and the two-layer search filters
  from [Search Filters](search-filters.md).
- Omit defaults: `cost = 10`, `cancel_if_invalid = yes`, `continue_if_invalid = no`,
  and `available_if_capitulated = no`.
- No empty `mutually_exclusive` or `available` blocks, or commented-out slot markers.
- Limit permanent effects to five. Use timed ideas for additional bonuses.
- Match `available` to a reachable bypass condition; never pair a bypass with
  `available = { always = no }`.
- Apply the spending-based bankruptcy guard below. Focus duration is not money cost.

## File Naming

| Prefix   | Usage                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `00_`    | System requirements only (e.g., titlebar)    |
| `01-04_` | Shared/joint trees (EU, African Union, etc.) |
| `05_`    | Country-specific trees                       |

Prefix number forces load order: shared trees load before country-specific ones.

## Focus Tree Container

```
focus_tree = {
 id = greece_focus

 country = {
  factor = 0
  modifier = {
   tag = GRE
   add = 100
  }
 }

 shared_focus = USoE001
 shared_focus = POTEF001

 continuous_focus_position = { x = 2350 y = 1200 }
}
```

## Required Property Order

```
1.  id                          (always first)
2.  icon                        (always second)
3.  x, y coordinates
4.  relative_position_id
5.  cost
6.  allow_branch
7.  prerequisite / mutually_exclusive
8.  search_filters
9.  available / bypass / cancel
10. completion_reward / select_effect / bypass_effect
11. ai_will_do                  (ALWAYS LAST)
```

## Shared and Joint Focuses

A **shared focus** lives in one tree file and appears in several countries' trees, each pulling it in via `shared_focus = X` inside their `focus_tree`. A **joint focus** (`joint_focus = { ... }`) is a shared focus that additionally **shares completion**: when one joint country completes it, it is marked complete for every country in its joint set.

`joint_trigger` defines the **joint set** — it is evaluated per country and determines who shares completion and receives the rewards. It is **not** a selection gate; who can actually pick the focus is still governed by `available` / `visible` / `prerequisite` / `allow_branch`, exactly as in a normal focus.

| Reward block                         | Fires on                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `completion_reward`                  | every joint country                              |
| `completion_reward_joint_originator` | only the country that directly completed it      |
| `completion_reward_joint_member`     | every joint country **other than** the completer |

### Conventions

- **All-members focus** — omit `joint_trigger` and gate `available` with the membership trigger (e.g. `benelux_cooperation_trigger`). When omitted, the default joint set is every country that has the tree, so `joint_trigger = { is_benelux_country = yes }` is redundant. `06_Commonwealth_Shared.txt` ships 38 joint focuses this way: no `joint_trigger`, `available = { is_commonwealth_member = yes }`, rewards shared across all members.
- **Country-specific focus** — gate `available` to that country **and** restrict the joint set with `joint_trigger = { original_tag = TAG }` (or an `OR` of tags). Do **not** rely on `available` alone here: the default joint set is structural (all tree-holders), so without a `joint_trigger` the other members can still receive shared completion and rewards when that country completes the focus. Keep the `joint_trigger` until this is verified in-game.

Joint focuses pick a `text_icon` titlebar style matching the joint set (`JOINT_BEL_LUX_HOL_focus_style`, `JOINT_HOL_focus_style`, etc.), defined in `common/national_focus/00_titlebar_styles.txt`.

Focus **titles carry no `§` color codes**, and descriptions use only `§Y` / `§G` / `§R` — see [Color Codes](localisation-rules.md#color-codes).

## Example: Basic Focus

```
focus = {
 id = SER_free_market_capitalism
 icon = blr_market_economy

 x = 5
 y = 3
 relative_position_id = SER_free_elections

 cost = 5

 prerequisite = { focus = SER_western_approach }
 search_filters = { FOCUS_FILTER_POLITICAL }

 available = {
  western_liberals_are_in_power = yes
 }

 completion_reward = {
  log = "[GetDateText]: [Root.GetName]: Focus SER_free_market_capitalism"
  add_ideas = SER_free_market_idea
 }

 ai_will_do = {
  base = 1
 }
}
```

## Example: Bankruptcy Guard in `ai_will_do`

A focus whose `completion_reward` spends money must prevent the AI from queueing it during financial collapse. The gate is the reward's actual money cost (a negative `treasury_change` applied via `modify_treasury_effect` summing to ~5bn or more, or a money-costing scripted/building effect), not the focus `cost` field, which is completion time. Do this in `ai_will_do`, not `available`, so the player is never blocked. A guard on a focus with no money cost is flagged as unneeded, so add it only where the reward actually spends:

```
focus = {
 id = ISR_milk_and_honey
 # ...
 cost = 10
 completion_reward = {
  # ... spends treasury:
  set_temp_variable = { treasury_change = -20 }
  modify_treasury_effect = yes
 }
 ai_will_do = {
  base = 3
  modifier = {
   factor = 0
   has_active_mission = bankruptcy_incoming_collapse
  }
 }
}
```

## Example: `available` Matching `bypass` Pattern

Never use `available = { always = no }` on a focus that also has a `bypass`. Set `available` to match or approximate the bypass condition:

```
focus = {
 id = ISR_operation_defensive_shield

 available = {
  has_country_flag = ISR_start_operation
 }

 bypass = {
  has_country_flag = ISR_start_operation
 }
 # ...
}
```

## Cross-Country Event Tooltips

When a focus fires an event to another country, add the `TT_IF_THEY_ACCEPT` / `TT_IF_THEY_REJECT` tooltip pattern — full rules and examples in `.claude/docs/event-reference.md` (Cross-Country Event Tooltips).

## Example: `country_exists` Guard + Wargoal

Always check `country_exists` before targeting another country with wargoals:

```
available = {
 country_exists = USA
 NOT = { has_war_with = USA }
 # ideology checks...
}

completion_reward = {
 log = "[GetDateText]: [This.GetName]: focus ISR_down_with_imperialism executed"
 set_temp_variable = { wargoal_on = USA }
 set_temp_variable = { wargoal_type = 1 }
 add_threat_from_wargoal_effect = yes
 create_wargoal = {
  type = topple_government
  target = USA
  expire = 365
 }
}
```

## Building Effects (Scripted)

All buildings in effects need monetary cost — use scripted effects from `common/scripted_effects/00_scripted_effects.txt`, not raw `add_building_construction`.

### State Scope (predefined state)

```
117 = {
 one_state_industrial_complex = yes
}
```

### Random Scope (any owned state)

```
one_random_industrial_complex = yes
two_random_industrial_complex = yes
```

Cost includes a building slot ($1.00). To give a building without a slot, subtract $1.00.
