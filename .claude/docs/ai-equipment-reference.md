# AI Equipment Reference

## Overview

AI equipment files (`common/ai_equipment/*.txt`) define equipment variants the AI aims for when assigning modules to tank, ship, or plane variants. They control what the AI designs and produces. Without proper coverage, AI nations will not produce equipment they need for their division templates.

## Role Template Structure

A role template is a top-level block in any file in the folder. The block name is its unique ID — **duplicates silently overwrite**.

```pdx
my_role_template = {
    category = land              # REQUIRED: land, naval, or air
    roles = { land_modern_tank } # REQUIRED: role names for role_ratio AI strategy
    available_for = { USA GER }  # Restricts to listed tags (omit for all)
    blocked_for = { ... }        # Excludes listed tags (only if no available_for)

    priority = {                 # REQUIRED: MTTH block for template importance
        factor = 200             # vs other role templates for spending XP
        modifier = {
            has_war = yes
            factor = 2
        }
    }

    # Design blocks go here...
}
```

### Role Template Arguments

| Argument                  | Required     | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `category`                | Yes          | `land`, `naval`, or `air` — tanks, ships, or planes |
| `roles = { ... }`         | Yes          | Role names for the `role_ratio` AI strategy         |
| `available_for = { ... }` | One of these | Restricts to listed country tags                    |
| `blocked_for = { ... }`   | One of these | Excludes listed tags (only if no `available_for`)   |
| `priority = { ... }`      | Yes          | MTTH block: importance vs other role templates      |

The AI tries to have one variant per role; the highest-priority template with the same roles wins.

## Design Block Structure

Within role templates, each design is a block with a unique name.

```pdx
my_design_name = {
    priority = {              # REQUIRED: importance vs other designs in this template
        factor = 100
        modifier = {
            has_tech = mbt_tech_3
            factor = 0        # Stop building when next tech available
        }
    }

    name = "My Tank"          # Optional: preset name. Without it, uses TAG_type_N_short loc.
    history = yes             # Optional: puts the design in the designer's preset folder
    role_icon_index = 2       # Optional: ship role icon (naval only)

    enable = { ... }          # Optional: trigger for when AI should aim for this design

    target_variant = {        # REQUIRED
        match_value = 1000    # REQUIRED: value to AI if matched
        type = medium_tank_chassis_2  # REQUIRED: specific equipment type

        modules = {           # Module slot assignments
            # Direct module assignment:
            main_armament_slot = tank_medium_cannon_2

            # any_of block (pick best available):
            turret_type_slot = {
                any_of = {
                    tank_medium_three_man_turret
                    tank_medium_two_man_turret
                }
            }

            # Module with upgrade requirement:
            engine_type_slot = {
                module = tank_gasoline_engine
                upgrade = current    # Keep same when upgrading (> = must upgrade)
            }

            # Using > or < for newer/older modules:
            armor_type_slot = > tank_welded_armor  # Aim for newest >= this
        }

        upgrades = {          # Optional: upgrade priorities
            tank_nsb_engine_upgrade = 3           # Fixed priority
            tank_nsb_armor_upgrade = {            # Dynamic MTTH priority
                base = 1
                modifier = { has_war = yes add = 2 }
            }
        }
    }

    requirements = { ... }    # Optional: required modules not tied to specific slots
                              # Same format as module slot assignments

    allowed_modules = {       # Optional: modules AI can pick after requirements met
        tank_smoke_launchers  # First listed = highest priority
        tank_radio
    }

    allowed_types = { ... }   # Optional: sub-units AI can add to design
                              # Omitted = AI never adds it
}
```

### Design Arguments

| Argument                            | Required | Description                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `priority = { ... }`                | Yes      | MTTH design importance within role template |
| `target_variant = { ... }`          | Yes      | The variant AI should aim for               |
| `target_variant.match_value`        | Yes      | Template's worth to AI if matched           |
| `target_variant.type`               | Yes      | Specific equipment type (chassis) to use    |
| `target_variant.modules = { ... }`  | Yes      | Module slot assignments                     |
| `target_variant.upgrades = { ... }` | No       | Upgrade priorities                          |
| `name = "..."`                      | No       | Preset name for the equipment               |
| `history = yes`                     | No       | Design appears in designer's preset folder  |
| `role_icon_index = N`               | No       | Ship role icon (naval only)                 |
| `enable = { ... }`                  | No       | Trigger for when AI should use this design  |
| `requirements = { ... }`            | No       | Required modules not tied to specific slots |
| `allowed_modules = { ... }`         | No       | Modules AI can pick beyond `target_variant` |
| `allowed_types = { ... }`           | No       | Sub-units AI can add; omitted = never added |

- `history = yes` is applied per group, not per design.
- `allowed_modules`: modules not listed are never picked.

### Module Slot Assignment Formats

```pdx
slot_name = module_name              # Direct module
slot_name = > module_name            # Direct with version comparison (> = newest, < = oldest)
slot_name = empty                    # Empty slot
slot_name = > empty                  # Ensure not empty

slot_name = {                        # any_of block
    any_of = {
        module_a
        module_b
    }
}

slot_name = {                        # With upgrade requirement
    module = module_name
    upgrade = current      # Keep same when upgrading
}
```

## Coverage Model

The generic files (`generic_tank.txt`, `generic_plane.txt`, `generic_naval.txt`) provide fallback designs for any nation without a custom file. They use `blocked_for = { ... }` to exclude nations that already have coverage. Whenever you add a custom equipment file for a tag, add that tag to `blocked_for` in the matching generic file — otherwise the AI may pick a generic design over the custom one.

**Every nation blocked from generic MUST have coverage in a custom or shared file for each role it needs.** Missing coverage = AI cannot produce that equipment type.

### Land Equipment Roles

| Role                        | Equipment Type         | Used By                            |

| Nation-specific `*_tank.txt` | Usually MBT only | Individual nations            |

## MTTH Blocks (Priority Syntax)

Priority blocks use Mean Time To Happen (MTTH) syntax:

- Starts at assumed value of 1
- `base = N` sets value to N (like multiply by 0 then add N)
- `factor = N` multiplies current value by N
- `add = N` adds N to current value
- `modifier = { ... }` applies operations conditionally (trigger + value operations)

```pdx
priority = {
    factor = 200          # Start: 1 * 200 = 200
    modifier = {
        has_war = yes
        factor = 2        # If at war: 200 * 2 = 400
    }
    modifier = {
        num_of_factories < 15
        factor = 0        # If < 15 factories: kill priority entirely
    }
}
```

## CV Plane ai_type System

Carrier-variant (CV) plane airframes must have `ai_type` set to one of 5 engine-recognized CV types. Any other `ai_type` (including land types like `heavy_fighter`) silently excludes the plane from carrier production — the engine treats it as a land plane.

Valid CV `ai_type` values:

| ai_type           | unit_ratio ID     | What it covers                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cv_fighter`      | `cv_fighter`      | MR fighters, AWACS/scouts (no dedicated cv_scout exists) |
| `cv_interceptor`  | `cv_interceptor`  | AS fighters                                              |
| `cv_cas`          | `cv_cas`          | CAS variants                                             |
| `cv_naval_bomber` | `cv_naval_bomber` | Naval bombers, maritime patrol                           |
| `cv_suicide`      | `cv_suicide`      | Drones, transports (no dedicated cv_transport exists)    |

When creating CV plane sub-archetypes, always set `ai_type` explicitly — do not rely on inheriting from the parent archetype, which may use a generic type.

## Equipment Role Chain

Three systems must align for AI equipment production to work:

```
Equipment design role (ai_equipment/) → Airframe ai_type (units/equipment/) → AI strategy unit_ratio (ai_strategy/)
```

1. **Equipment design `roles = { X }`** — tells AI which design template to use
2. **Airframe `ai_type = Y`** — tells engine which production bucket the airframe belongs to
3. **AI strategy `unit_ratio id = Y`** — tells AI what proportion of production to allocate

If any link is missing, the AI either can't build the equipment or doesn't know it should.

## Naval Goals Structure

Naval goal files (`common/ai_navy/goals/`) must define a **complete set of all objective types** per nation. Vanilla blocks custom nations from generic goals and gives each a full replacement set. Partial overrides cause duplicate goals (both generic and custom apply simultaneously).

**Required objective types per nation** (11 total):
`naval_invasion_support`, `naval_invasion_defense`, `coast_defense`, `convoy_protection`, `convoy_raiding`, `naval_dominance`, `naval_blockade`, `mines_sweeping`, `mines_planting`, `training`, `strike_force_objective`

When adding a new nation's goals file:

1. Define all 11 objective types with `available_for = { TAG }`
2. Add the TAG to `blocked_for` on every generic goal entry in `goals_generic.txt`
3. Customize min/max_priority to match the nation's naval doctrine

## Screen Destroyer Role

MD splits destroyers into two sub_units: `destroyer` (capital_ship) and `screen_destroyer` (screen_ship). Both use the same equipment (`need_equipment = { destroyer = 1 }`), following vanilla's light_cruiser/heavy_cruiser pattern.

For nations that need distinct ASW-focused screen destroyers (e.g., USA), add a `naval_screen_destroyer` role with ASW-optimized designs (sonar, torpedoes, ASW missiles). Add corresponding `role_ratio` in the AI strategy file.

## Taskforce Composition Limits

NAI defines in `common/defines/MD_defines.lua` cap how many ships the AI puts per category in a single taskforce. The `optimal_composition` in fleet templates is silently capped by these:

| Define                                | Value | Category     |
| ------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `CARRIER_TASKFORCE_MAX_CARRIER_COUNT` | 2     | carrier      |
| `CAPITAL_TASKFORCE_MAX_CAPITAL_COUNT` | 6     | capital_ship |
| `SCREEN_TASKFORCE_MAX_SHIP_COUNT`     | 8     | screen_ship  |
| `SUB_TASKFORCE_MAX_SHIP_COUNT`        | 8     | submarine    |

Ship types per category:

- carrier — carrier, helicopter_operator
- capital_ship — battleship, battle_cruiser, cruiser, stealth_destroyer, destroyer, heavy_frigate
- screen_ship — screen_destroyer, stealth_frigate, frigate, corvette, stealth_corvette, patrol_boat
- submarine — missile_submarine, attack_submarine

**If an optimal_composition exceeds these caps, the excess ships are silently ignored.** The `validate_ai_navy` pre-commit hook catches violations.

Other relevant ratios:

- `CAPITALS_TO_CARRIER_RATIO = 2` — AI wants 2 capitals per carrier
- `SCREENS_TO_CAPITAL_RATIO = 3` — AI wants 3 screens per capital
- `MIN_CAPITALS_FOR_CARRIER_TASKFORCE = 2` — need 2 capitals to form carrier TF

### Fleet Sizing for Large Navies

Nations with many ships (100+) need sufficient fleet/taskforce slots to absorb them:

- Increase `optional_taskforces` counts in fleet templates
- Add more fleet template varieties (patrol, escort, submarine, corvette fleets)
- The AI creates **multiple instances** of each fleet template if ships are available
- Keep taskforce sizes within define caps; create more taskforces rather than larger ones

### NOT Block AND Trap in Priority Blocks

`NOT = { tag = A tag = B }` means NOT(A AND B) — always true since a country can only be one tag. Common copy-paste error in priority blocks:

```pdx
# WRONG — always evaluates true, modifier never applies
modifier = {
    factor = 0
    NOT = {
        tag = USA
        tag = ENG
    }
}

# CORRECT — zeroes priority for any nation not in the list
modifier = {
    factor = 0
    NOT = {
        OR = {
            tag = USA
            tag = ENG
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Wrong module in slot** (e.g., armor in `reload_type_slot`) — AI fails to build valid variant. Fix: check module matches slot type.
- **Duplicate role template names across files** — second silently overwrites first. Fix: use unique names per template.
- **`roles = { medium_as_fighter }` on CAS designs** — AI deploys CAS as air superiority. Fix: use `medium_cas_fighter` for CAS.
- **Factory threshold `< 15` on small nations** — nation can never produce. Fix: use date checks or lower thresholds.
- **Missing top-level `priority` on role template** — undefined AI priority behavior. Fix: always include `priority = { factor = N }`.
- **`available_for` overlap between templates for same role** — AI gets competing designs. Fix: verify intent; remove overlap if not wanted.
- **Missing `allowed_modules`** — AI won't pick any modules beyond `target_variant.modules`. Fix: add if AI should use extra modules.
- **CV plane `ai_type = heavy_fighter` (land type)** — plane excluded from carrier production entirely. Fix: use one of 5 valid CV ai_types (see above).
- **`equipment_variant_production_factor = -95` on base type** — subtypes inherit penalty even with positive overrides. Fix: keep base type penalty mild (-25 max).
- **Nation excluded from generic but no custom role coverage** — AI cannot produce that equipment type at all. Fix: run `validate_ai_equipment.py`.
- **Partial naval goals (only overriding a few types)** — duplicate goals: both generic and custom apply. Fix: define complete set of all 11 objective types.
- **Nation blocked from generic air with no custom strategy** — zero interceptor/bomber/drone production. Fix: verify every excluded nation has full air doctrine.
- **`NOT = { tag=A tag=B }` in priority block** — modifier never fires (AND trap). Fix: use `NOT = { OR = { tag=A tag=B } }`.
- **`factor = 0` for nation + nation not in `blocked_for`** — nation uses template but with zero priority. Fix: either block the nation or remove factor=0.
- **Duplicate design names within a role template** — second silently overwrites first, design is lost. Fix: use unique names (e.g., `_improved`, `_next`).
- **Optimal composition exceeds NAI define caps** — engine silently caps ships; excess wasted. Fix: run `validate_ai_navy.py`, respect define limits.
- **`AP_` prefix on design names (copy-paste from JAP)** — no functional impact but confuses debugging. Fix: use correct tag prefix.
