# AI Strategy & Unit Production Reference

## System Architecture

5 AI layers firing at different frequencies:

```
LAYER 1: INITIALIZATION (on_startup, once)
  give_AI_templates ──► creates division templates
  yearly_investment_targets_routine ──► builds investment target list

LAYER 2: CONTINUOUS STRATEGIES (ai_strategy files, always-evaluated)

```

## On-Action Entry Points

### on_startup (`common/on_actions/00_on_actions.txt`)

- **AI Template Init**: every AI country (zombie/joke tags excluded, see `give_AI_templates`) → `give_AI_templates`. Also sets microstate tax rates and investment targets.

### on_daily (`common/on_actions/00_on_actions.txt`)

- **AI Unit-Cap Cache**: AI only → monthly division/plane/ship limiter calculations, plus immediate refreshes on war-relation changes.

### on_monthly (`common/on_actions/MD_on_actions.txt`)

- **AI Weapon Dump**: All AI → `ai_weapon_dump`
- **AI Taxes**: All AI → `calculate_ai_taxes_desire`
- **AI Influence**: AI + PP > 200 + not subject + not bankrupt → `influence.500`
- **AI Investment Targets** (January only): Regional+ powers → `yearly_investment_targets_routine`
- **AI UN Actions**: `un_ai_evaluate_actions`
- **AI Recognition**: `recog_ai_monthly`
- **God of War**: `ai_add_xp`, and if no player allies + threat > 0.3: `ai_add_equipment` + `ai_spawn_units`

### on_weekly (`common/on_actions/MD_on_actions.txt`)

- **AI Investment Pulse**: Regional+ powers with investment targets → `AC_event.500`
- **AI Cyber**: Rotates through 4 weekly batches → `ai_cyber_monthly`
- **AI Counter-Terror** (same batch rotation): `global.active_terror_orgs^num > 0` → `ct_ai_weekly`

### Other on_actions

- **on_puppet** (`01_tfv_on_actions.txt`): AI puppeted nations → `give_AI_templates`
- **on_declare_war** (`00_on_actions.txt`): AI combatants with cyber capability → `ai_cyber_add_target` on each other
- **on_join_faction / on_leave_faction** (`MD_on_actions.txt`): AI reserve currency auto-switch (Chinese faction → yuan, Russian → rouble, else → dollar)

Threat state is no longer pushed by these hooks. It is evaluated live by the `ai_is_threatened` scripted trigger (see below), so nothing has to set or refresh a flag on war/justification/liberation.

## Scripted Effects

### `ai_is_threatened` (`common/scripted_triggers/00_scripted_triggers.txt`)

Live threat check, evaluated on demand (no cached flag, no daily refresh):

```
ai_is_threatened = {
    OR = {
        has_war = yes
        threat > 0.30
        check_variable = { potential_and_current_enemies^num > 0 }
    }
}
```

`potential_and_current_enemies` is a built-in engine array (current enemies + allies-of-enemies + countries with wargoals), so it already covers hostile neighbours without a live neighbour loop. When `ai_is_threatened`:

- The division/plane/ship limiter caps expand (1.25x multiplier inside the monthly and transition refresh).
- The division cap no longer receives its 0.75x peaceful-country reduction.

This replaced the old `ai_update_build_units` effect and its `AI_is_threatened` country flag (removed).

### `division_limiter_calculation` / `plane_limiter_calculation` / `ship_limiter_calculation` (`00_AI_scripted_effects.txt`)

Run monthly for AI countries, with additional refreshes on relevant war transitions. Each computes a cap from factory count and situational multipliers (war, `ai_is_threatened`, major, NATO/EU, threat, faction, great-power) and stores it in `division_limiter_limit` / `plane_limiter_limit` / `ship_limiter_limit`. The plane refresh also caches deployed plane count in `plane_limiter_deployed_size`. Matching limiter strategies read cached variables in `enable` instead of recomputing live counts every evaluation. Under the `potato_edition` game rule the same formula runs, then the result is halved (`x0.5`) and re-rounded.

### `ai_weapon_dump` (`99_weapon_dump_effects.txt`)

Monthly, all AI at peace with threat < 0.51. Sells excess equipment for 30 treasury per dump:

- Infantry weapons > 150k → dump 25k (x2)
- CNC > 20k → dump 5k
- L_AT/AA > 12k → dump 2k each
- Various tank chassis > 2.5-5k → dump 500 each
- Artillery > 5k → dump 750

### `calculate_ai_taxes_desire` (`00_money_system.txt`)

Monthly tax rate adjustment:

- **Raise taxes** if deficit (treasury_rate < -1 for pop, < -2 for corp, or interest > 8%). Caps: pop=40, corp=50.
- **Lower taxes** if surplus (treasury_rate > 2, debt_ratio < 0.30, interest < 5). Prefers lowering corp first.
- **Low stability override**: Lowers pop tax if stability < 0.25.

### AI Investment System (`99_AI_investment_scripted_effects.txt`)

10 building-type scoring effects. Each scores states with base value + bonuses/penalties:

- CIC (base 170), MIC (base 150), Dockyard (base 170), Infra (base 175), Offices (base 180)
- AA (base 120), Radar (base 115), Airbase (base 130)
- High `threat` (tiered at 0.1 / 0.2 / 0.4) adds to military buildings
- All add randomization (±15) to prevent same state always winning

### AI Influence System (`99_AI_influence_scripted_effects.txt`)

Monthly target selection scoring: player targets (+30 veteran), faction members (+25), guarantees (+20), trade agreements (+35), existing influence position (up to +95), same ideology (+25), opinion (0.3x clamped), same continent (+25).

### Template Conversion Decisions (`99_ai_templates_decisions.txt`)

All four require no active war. Cooldown: 300 days, except `UKR_convert_stuff` (fire once),
which converts all militia → L_Inf and all L_Inf → mech.

| Decision                       | Requirements                     | Converts             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `convert_militia_to_light_inf` | weapons > 2k, CNC > 500, MIL > 5 | 5 militia → L_Inf    |
| `convert_l_inf_to_mot_inf`     | util vehicles > 500, MIL > 10    | 5 L_Inf → motorized  |
| `convert_mot_to_mech_inf`      | APC chassis > 500, MIL > 20      | 5 mot → mechanized   |
| `UKR_convert_stuff`            | UKR, date > 2000.6               | all (see note above) |

## AI Strategy Files

### Strategy Structure

```pdx
my_strategy = {
    allowed = { ... }            # Checked ONCE at game start (permanent gate)
    enable = { ... }             # Checked continuously
    abort = { ... }              # If true, removes strategy (must be false to activate)
    abort_when_not_enabled = yes # Also removes if enable becomes false

    ai_strategy = {
        type = role_ratio        # Strategy type
        id = armor               # Target (role, tag, etc.)
        value = 50               # Positive = more, negative = less
    }
}
```

### Reversed Strategies

`reversed = yes` swaps direction: instead of "this country does X to id", it becomes "id does X to this country". Requires `enable_reverse = { ... }` (no default scope, must scope into a country).

Example: Iran's `PER_support_shias` makes Shia countries support Iran (rather than Iran supporting them).

### War & Conquer Weighting (`conquer` + `avoid_starting_wars`)

`avoid_starting_wars` is **additive with the `conquer` strategy and targetless** (per vanilla `_documentation.md`) — it combines with per-target `conquer` weights rather than acting as a standalone "avoidance" dial, so its effect depends on the conquer context. Vanilla's example uses a large negative value to suppress all targets, then `conquer` to carve out one:

```pdx
ai_strategy = { type = avoid_starting_wars value = -200 }   # targetless, additive with conquer
ai_strategy = { type = conquer id = GER value = 200 }       # GER: -200+200 = 0 (the only viable target); everyone else -200
```

Vanilla notes this is "meant for very specific situations, and should not be used widely."

In MD both signs appear intentionally:

- Small **positive** values as a general brake on opening new wars (e.g. RAJ's insurgency strategies use `+20` / `+50` while suppressing a rebellion). The mod author has confirmed positive = stronger avoidance in this usage.
- **Negative** values for the targetless-suppression technique above (e.g. RAJ's `-100` while already at war with Pakistan, to avoid opening new fronts).

**Do not flag an `avoid_starting_wars` value as a sign bug** in either direction without checking the surrounding `conquer` strategies and the author's intent. It is nuanced, not a simple "higher = more peaceful" scalar.

Authoritative token reference: vanilla `common/ai_strategy/_documentation.md` (in the HOI4 install). Mirror gotchas here as they come up.

### `declare_war` — target-keyed only, and pre-war only

`declare_war` weights the AI's desire to **open** a war on one target. Two consequences:

- **There is no generic form.** It requires `id = TAG`; `target =` is not accepted, and `dont_declare_war` is not a token at all (absent from vanilla `_documentation.md`, which lists only `declare_war` and `dont_join_wars_with`). The targetless equivalent is `avoid_starting_wars`.
- **`enable = { has_war_with = TARGET }` makes it a no-op** — you cannot declare war on a country you are already fighting. Gate on `has_wargoal_against = X` + `NOT = { has_war_with = X }` instead, as `MD_war_declaration_ai.txt` and `BOS_avoid_unready_war_with_cro` do.

306 `TAG_cancel_war_TARGET` blocks carrying that no-op gate were deleted from 18 files and replaced by one mod-wide block in `MD_war_declaration_ai.txt`:

```pdx
MD_avoid_new_wars_when_outmatched = {
 enable = {
  has_war = yes
  enemies_strength_ratio > 0.75
 }
 abort_when_not_enabled = yes

 ai_strategy = { type = avoid_starting_wars value = -200 }
}
```

Omitting `allowed` applies a strategy to every country (precedent: `save_pp_for_laws`, `AI_generic_office_construction`, `default_area_priority`). Do not re-add per-tag `*_cancel_war_*` blocks, and do not write a per-tag `TAG_avoid_starting_wars` on a plain `enemies_strength_ratio` gate — anything stricter than `> 0.75` is already covered by the mod-wide block and does nothing. A per-tag brake earns its place only on a gate the strength ratio cannot express, such as `BLR`/`SOV` firing on NATO/EU-aligned enemies at any strength.

**Ratio direction differs between the two triggers.** `strength_ratio = { tag = X ratio < 1 }` means the scope country is weaker than X. `enemies_strength_ratio` rises as the scope country's enemies get stronger — MD's peace-deal triggers read `> 1.7` as losing and `> 2.0` as massively outgunned (`common/scripted_triggers/00_peace_deal_triggers.txt`).

### `MD_combat_ai_strategies.txt` — Production & Combat

**Army production (3 tiers by factory count):**

All three share the `default_army_production_strategy` name prefix:

| Suffix    | MIL Range | Key Ratios                                                      |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (none)    | < 11      | L_Inf=30, infantry=25, mech/IFV=50, armor=35, SF=20, marines=15 |
| `_maj`    | 11–29     | Infantry=15, IFV=50, armor=40, SF=25, marines=25                |
| `_global` | 30+       | Infantry=30, APC=30, IFV=35, armor=25, SF=6, marines=10         |

**Note:** `_maj` covers 11–29 MIL. `_global` replaces it at 30+ MIL so advanced-role weights do not stack.

**Emergency strategies:**

- `default_AI_needs_to_live`: surrender > 49% → L_Inf=150
- `MD_wartime_low_infantry_weapons`: At war + low weapons → halt training and prioritize weapons
- `MD_wartime_low_command_equipment` / `_utility_vehicles` / `_light_at` / `_aa`: Shift wartime recruitment toward emergency light infantry while prioritizing the missing equipment
- `MD_desperately_need_guns`: Zero infantry weapons → massive production, all training halted

**Equipment production (3 tiers):**

| Strategy                         | MIL Range | Focus                                  |
| -------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `MD_poor_production_strategy`    | < 6       | Infantry weapons dominate              |
| `MD_default_production_strategy` | 6-10      | Balanced with mech/armor intro         |
| `MD_major_production_strategy`   | > 10      | Full spectrum with min factory targets |

APCs use the `amphibious` equipment category and IFVs use `flame`, not
`mechanized`. Countries with enough factories, a healthy rifle stockpile, and
less than 1,000 APCs or IFVs receive a +400% perceived factory demand for the
matching category. Countries with more than 10 military factories also reserve
one factory each for APCs and IFVs. Command equipment shortages increase total
`infantry`-category factory demand by 100% and raise command equipment's variant
weight to compete with infantry weapons. The wartime response below 500
stockpile adds a second +100% category-demand increase.

**Division/Ship/Plane Limiters:**

- `division_limiter`: (factories + 5 when factories > 4) × 1.3 × situational modifiers. Peaceful, unthreatened countries receive a 0.75x reduction instead of being blocked from training. Active war scales up (~1.75x, wars demand more divisions than peacetime), `ai_is_threatened` adds ~1.25x, major status adds ~1.15x. Alliances that constrain unilateral builds (NATO, EU) apply a negative multiplier (~-0.8x) so members don't all maintain peer-major standing armies.
- `division_limiter_potato_edition`: 0.5x base for the "performance" rule path. Limiter inputs are cached and unchanged AI states skip recalculation.
- `ship_limiter`: naval_factories × ~7 (or ×3 potato), tuned so a typical naval power lands at a plausible fleet size, not the engine's hard cap.
- `plane_limiter`: mil_factories × ~80 + 50 (or ×40 potato), accounts for air industries producing many cheap units per factory vs ground.

**Unit build controls:**

- `division_limiter`: Above the current situational cap → all land-role build weights -500
- `under_division_cap_recruitment`: Threatened countries below their cap
  → wanted divisions +0.15
- `minor_wartime_recruitment`: Non-major countries at war and below their
  cap → force_build=20
- `threatened_peacetime_recruitment`: Threatened countries at peace and below
  their cap → force_build=25
- `ai_subject_defensive_build`: Subjects at peace → garrison=5, L_Inf=10, infantry=5, force_build=25

**Air production (3 tiers):**

- `< 25 MIL`: Tactical bombers only
- `25-49 MIL`: Mixed CAS + interceptors + tactical
- `> 49 MIL`: Full air force (heavy fighters, strategic bombers)

### `MD_econ_ai.txt` — Economic Behavior

**PP spending:**

- `save_pp_for_laws`: Major economic problems → save all PP for law changes
- `AI_idea_focus`: Surplus + lacking top ideas → massive idea spending (5000)

**Factory building targets (scaled by power level):**

| Power Level     | CIC Target |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Minor/non-power | +50        |
| Regional        | +75        |
| Large           | +100       |
| Great           | +125       |
| Super           | +150       |

**Economic crisis response:**

- `AI_stop_building_civilian_industry`: < 1% unemployment → halt industry, build internet/infra
- `AI_reduce_construction_on_deficit`: High deficit → -20 all building
- `AI_halt_construction_major_crisis`: Major problems → -50 all building
- `AI_no_military_industry`: Peacetime + low threat + < 5 available civs → no mils

**Microchip/composite production:**

- Nations consuming + importing more than producing → build chip/composite factories.
- Custom production strategies exist for the major industrial powers (currently USA, CHI, FRA, GER, JAP, KOR, CAN); other nations fall back to generic logic. Add a new strategy when a country becomes a significant chip/composite producer in scenario terms.

### `naval.txt` — Naval Behavior

**Default ratios:** Corvettes=30, frigates=20, destroyers=10, attack subs=25, mine sweepers=5

**Mission management:**

- Peacetime: Patrol, strike force, convoy escort/raid
- Fuel < 25%: Halt most missions
- All enemies landlocked: Halt all naval
- Peacetime + any navy: Halt all missions (conserve fuel)

**Regional dominance (war-triggered):** 10 theater-specific strategies covering Pacific, Chinese coastline, Middle East, Mediterranean, Atlantic, Indian Ocean.

### Country-Specific Files (107 files)

**Key force_build_armies values:**

| Country | Value     | Condition                             |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| USA     | 50        | Always                                |

| DPR/HPR | 150       | Always                                |
| CHE     | 150       | Always                                |
| ZOM     | 200       | Always                                |

**Offensive preparation:**

- `MD_war_declaration_ai.txt`: Countries holding specific scripted wargoals
  request units for the target front and receive force_build=30–40 until war
  begins.

**Notable diplomacy patterns:**

- **Japan**: Most pacifist AI, `JAP_no_war_if_at_war` sets `declare_war = -200` against 30 neighbors
- **SOV**: `SOV_cancel_war_chi_guaranteed` sets `declare_war = -4000` against nations guaranteed by TUR/CHI
- **USA during War on Terror**: `pp_spend_priority` forces decision spending (decisions=250, all others=-9999)

## AI Strategy Plans (`common/ai_strategy_plans/`)

22 files defining political path priorities. Key features:

## MTTH Blocks (Priority/Weight Syntax)

Used throughout the AI system for priorities, weights, and `ai_will_do` values.

- Starts at assumed value of **1**
- `base = N` — sets value to N
- `factor = N` — multiplies current value by N
- `add = N` — adds N to current value
- Operations apply **in order** (top to bottom)
- `modifier = { ... }` — conditional: triggers + value operations
- Variables can be used in value arguments

### ai_will_do vs ai_chance

- `ai_will_do` — focuses, tech, decisions. AI picks highest value after generating random [0, value].
- `ai_chance` — event options. Probability-proportional-to-size with d100. Min probability = 1%.

## Common Pitfalls

- **`role_ratio id = mechanized`** — wasted production weight; use `apc_mechanized` or `ifv_mechanized`.
- **`role = armored` in templates** — template never selected; use `armor`.
- **Case-mismatched unit names** — battalion silently missing; caught by `validate_oob_units` pre-commit hook.
- **Factory threshold gaps** — no template at specific factory count; ensure contiguous ranges.
- **Overlapping MIL-tier enable ranges** — role weights stack unexpectedly; keep generic, major, and global tiers exclusive.
- **Missing equipment coverage for blocked nations** — AI can't produce equipment; check all roles covered.
- **CAS designs with `medium_as_fighter` role** — deployed as air superiority; use `medium_cas_fighter`.
