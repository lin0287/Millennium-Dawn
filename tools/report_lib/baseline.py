"""Validation baseline: store main-side findings, classify PR findings.

The nightly `check-baseline` job in validator-cache.yml persists the
per-validator JSON sidecars of a full main run as the shared baseline. PR
report jobs restore that entry (keyed on the validator source hash) and use
the key set here to tag every finding NEW (not on the latest main run) or
EXISTING (also present there).

Fingerprint: (severity, category, file, line, message) — the report_lib
dedupe key plus severity, computed after the same cross-validator dedupe
runs on both sides. Severity is part of the key so an existing warning that
escalates to an error reads as a new error (the alarm direction). Known
limitations:
  - an unrelated edit that shifts lines makes existing findings look NEW;
  - a PR that runs only a subset of validators can tag an existing finding
    NEW when main's cross-validator dedupe escalated its severity but the
    PR's subset didn't (see classify).
