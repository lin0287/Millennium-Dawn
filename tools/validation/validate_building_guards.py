"""Validate that `damage_building` / `remove_building` effects are guarded by a
check that the named building actually exists.

Calling either effect against a building the state/country doesn't have spams
`error.log` and, at the scale MD runs raids and random-list decisions,
degrades performance across the campaign (issue #2806).

The rule: the `type = <building>` an effect names must also be proven present
by a trigger sitting between the effect and the top of its enclosing script
tree. "Proven present" is read strictly:

  - Only a comparison that cannot hold at level zero counts: `X > 0` (or any
    higher bound), `X >= 1`, `X == 1`. `X < 1`, `X <= 0`, `X == 0` and `X != 0`
    prove nothing about presence.
  - A comparison inside `NOT` / `OR` / `NAND` / `NOR` / `count_triggers` proves
    nothing -- a disjunct may be the branch that did not hold.
  - A comparison inside an `any_*` / `all_*` scope block proves nothing about
    the scope the effect runs in. `any_core_state = { arms_factory > 1 }` says
    some state has one, never that the selected state does.

The mod's accepted guard idioms, all derived from live usage:

  - A bare building-count comparison in an enclosing `limit`. That is the
    `if = { limit = { fuel_silo > 0 } ... }` form every `common/raids/` site
    uses, and the same `limit` on a scoped iterator (`random_owned_state =
    { limit = { dockyard > 0 } ... }`, `every_owned_state`,
    `random_core_state`, `random_controlled_state`, ...).
  - `non_damaged_building_level = { building = X ... }` or
    `any_province_building_level = { building = X ... }` (also accepts
    `has_building` / `num_of_buildings`, both unused today) anywhere in the
    limit, however deeply nested.
  - A sibling `modifier = { factor = 0  X < 1 }` zeroing a `random_list`
    bucket's weight when the building is absent. The polarity is inverted
    there: the bucket runs only when the condition fails, so it is the
    *absence* comparison that proves presence.

A state selector (`random_owned_state`, `every_core_state`, ...) picks a state
of its own, so proof gathered outside it does not carry in: each one must
carry its own `limit` naming the building. Fixed scopes (`652 = { ... }`,
`var:target_state = { ... }`) do inherit, since they name one specific state.

`non_damaged_building_level` and `num_of_buildings` only resolve *state*
buildings. Naming a province building in one is a load-time error -- the game
logs `Not a valid state building: building` and the trigger never validates --
so those two are additionally reported, and do not count as a guard. Use the
bare `naval_base > 0` comparison or `any_province_building_level` instead.

`trigger` / `available` / `visible` / `allowed` are not guards: a
country-level `any_owned_state = { arms_factory > 0 }` does not prove the
state the effect runs on has that building. `effect_tooltip` subtrees are
skipped because they only preview effects and never execute.

This is WARNING-only while the rule remains in rollout.
