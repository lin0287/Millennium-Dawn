"""Validate that DLC-gated technologies and special projects are guarded.

A technology whose folder is disabled without a DLC still parses, but the game
crashes when a tooltip resolves a reference into the disabled folder: hovering
China's `CHI_project_jxx` focus with no DLC enabled was a reproducible CTD
(issue #2790). The same applies to `sp:<project>` references whose project is
`allowed = { has_dlc = "..." }`.

The rule: any `add_tech_bonus` naming a DLC-gated technology, and any `sp:`
reference to a DLC-gated project, must sit inside an
`if = { limit = { has_dlc = "X" } }` branch, or under an equivalent
trigger/available/visible/allowed gate on the enclosing object.

Gating is derived, not hardcoded:
  - `common/technology_tags/*.txt` -- a folder's `available` block.
  - `common/technologies/*.txt` -- a tech's own `allow_branch`, plus the gate of
    its folders (only when every folder it sits in carries the same gate).
  - A research category counts as gated only when every tech carrying it shares
    one gate.
  - `common/special_projects/projects/*.txt` -- a project's `allowed` block.

A named technology or project is an ERROR: it crashes the game. A fully gated
category is a WARNING: it resolves to nothing and only wastes the bonus.
