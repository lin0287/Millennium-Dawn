# Millennium Dawn Validation Tools

Content validators for the Millennium Dawn mod. All validators share a common CLI interface. Cacheable validators can be run all at once via `run_all_validators.py`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all cacheable validators (from the mod root)
python3 tools/validation/run_all_validators.py

# Strict mode: exit non-zero if any issues found (used in CI)
python3 tools/validation/run_all_validators.py --strict

# Only check staged files (pre-commit mode)
python3 tools/validation/run_all_validators.py --staged --strict

# Save combined report to a file
python3 tools/validation/run_all_validators.py --output report.txt
```

Output is color-coded. Pass `--no-color` for plain text (e.g. in log files).

## Common Flags

All validators accept the same set of flags:

| Flag                       | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--path PATH`              | Path to the mod root (default: current directory)                                       |
| `--staged`                 | Only validate files currently staged in git                                             |
| `--strict`                 | Exit with code `1` if any issues are found                                              |
| `--output FILE`, `-o FILE` | Write results to a file in addition to stdout                                           |
| `--no-color`               | Disable ANSI color codes                                                                |
| `--workers N`              | Number of parallel worker processes (default: CPU count / 2, clamped to the CPU budget) |

### CPU budget

Tooling takes 75% of the cores and leaves the rest, so a run does not lock up
the machine someone is working on. Everything that fans out draws on the same
ceiling (`cpu_budget` in `tools/shared_utils.py`): the suite caps how many
validators run at once and passes each a share of the workers, the pre-commit
hook splits the same budget across its fan-out, and `--workers N` is clamped to
it. CI runners get every core. `MD_MAX_WORKERS=N` overrides both.

---

## Running a Single Validator

Every validator can be run standalone with the same flags:

```bash
python3 tools/validation/validate_events.py --path .
python3 tools/validation/validate_localisation.py --path . --staged --strict
python3 tools/validation/validate_ai_roles.py --path . --output ai-roles.txt
```

---

## Output Format

When validators find issues they print a grouped summary and write a `.json` sidecar file (used by `run_all_validators.py` to build the combined report):

```
================================================================================
Checking events missing is_triggered_only = yes...
================================================================================
  events/example.txt:42 - some_event.1 is missing is_triggered_only = yes
1 issue(s) found

################################################################################
✗ VALIDATION COMPLETE - 1 ERROR(S)
################################################################################
```

When `run_all_validators.py` detects failures it prints a **combined report** grouped by file with line numbers:

```
================================================================================
COMBINED VALIDATION REPORT
================================================================================
Total validators run: 12

✗ 2 ERROR(S)

  events/example.txt (2 issue(s))
    - events/example.txt:42: [events] some_event.1 is missing is_triggered_only = yes
    - events/example.txt:87: [events] some_event.2 is missing is_triggered_only = yes
```

---

## Pre-Commit Integration

Validators are integrated into `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and run automatically
on commit. The hook passes `--staged` so only the files being committed are
checked, keeping commit times fast.

To bypass for a single commit (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

### Pre-commit vs CI

To keep commit latency low, only a fast subset of validators runs on
`git commit`. Heavy cross-reference validators such as
`validate_scripted_gui`, `validate_localisation`, `validate_cosmetic_tags`,
`validate_variables`, and `validate_focus_tree` run
**CI-only**. The
`mod-tests` batch jobs in
`.github/workflows/test-suite.yml` gate them instead of pre-commit.
Their list, changed-group selection, and `--strict` gates live in
`tools/validation/validator_batches.py`.

The commit-stage validators (`validate_common_mistakes`, `validate_style`,
`validate_oob_units`, `validate_ai_roles`, `validate_ai_navy`,
`validate_characters`, `validate_ai_equipment`, `validate_agency_upgrades`,
`validate_ideas`, `validate_events`, `validate_standardization`, and
`validate_mios`) run through the
`md-validate-content` pre-commit hook. It fans them out in parallel through
`tools/precommit_validate.py`. `validate_defines` keeps its own commit-stage
hook. `validate_unused_textures` keeps a `stages: [manual]` hook because CI
cannot run it.

`validate_file_paths` runs CI-only in the `prepare-workspace` job of
`test-suite.yml`. It reads the PR git index rather than the working tree,
against a blob:none checkout that keeps `.git`. The batch jobs restore the
prepared content bundle with no `.git` and no `map/`. Standalone style,
descriptor, and encoding checks run inside the core batch job; the manual
texture audit stays excluded.

To run any validator locally, including a CI-only one, invoke it directly:

```bash
python3 tools/validation/validate_scripted_gui.py --staged --no-color  # changed files only
python3 tools/validation/validate_scripted_gui.py --no-color           # full-repo scan
```

---

## Refreshing Vanilla Data

CI has no HOI4 install, so `validate_defines`, `validate_file_paths`, `validate_gfx_references` and `validate_modifiers` read checked-in copies of vanilla data instead: `vanilla_defines.txt`, `vanilla_gui_files.txt`, `vanilla_paths.txt`, `vanilla_sprites.txt`, and `resources/documentation/*.md`. `refresh_vanilla_data.py` rebuilds all five from a local install (`$HOI4_PATH`, else auto-detected from Steam's `libraryfolders.vdf` or the VS Code HOI4 extension `installPath` settings):

```bash
python3 tools/validation/refresh_vanilla_data.py
python3 tools/validation/refresh_vanilla_data.py --only docs sprites
```

Run it after every HOI4 version bump and commit the diff. Stale data never fails CI. It produces false positives instead, which is worse: a modifier or sprite Paradox added after the last refresh reads as a typo. Details in `.claude/docs/validation-pipeline.md`.

## Architecture

All validators extend `BaseValidator` from `validator_common.py`. To add a new validator:

1. Create `validate_<name>.py` in this directory
2. Subclass `BaseValidator`, set `TITLE = "..."`, implement `run_validations()`
3. Use `self.add_error(category, message, file, line)` / `self.add_warning(...)` to record issues
4. To parse many files, call `self.parse_files_cached(patterns, namespace, parse_fn)` — it's staged-aware, case-preserving, and disk-caches each parse keyed on file content. Use a unique `namespace` string per call to avoid cache collisions.
5. Call `run_validator_main(YourValidator, "Description")` at the bottom
6. `run_all_validators.py` auto-discovers it on the next run unless it is intentionally manual-only

`validator_common.py` also provides `strip_comments()`, `FileOpener`, `DataCleaner`, `HOI4_BUILTIN_BLOCKS`, and `scan_meta_constructed_names()` for use in validators.

Module-level constants and pool-worker functions (those passed to `_pool_map`) must be defined at the **top level** — not inside the validator class — so `multiprocessing.Pool` can pickle them. Classmethods on a validator subclass are not directly picklable; use standalone functions for pool dispatch.
