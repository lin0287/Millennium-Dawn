"""Regression test for the decisions block matcher and a stray `\t}` line.

`_DECISIONS_BLOCK_RE` confines a decision's name to its own line (`[^\t#\n]`).
Before that, the name could span newlines, so a dangling tab-indented `}`
(a malformed extra brace) let the non-greedy match jump across a blank line and
the next column-0 `category = {` header, swallowing an unrelated block.
