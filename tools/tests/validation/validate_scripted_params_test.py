"""Unit tests for validate_scripted_params.

Pins these behaviors for change_influence_percentage:
  1. tag_index and influence_target stay OPTIONAL (the effect's own
     fallbacks to ROOT / THIS are reliable defaults and are used by the
     majority of call sites — the `for_each_scope_loop` pattern depends
     on influence_target defaulting to THIS).
  2. When a call site does set BOTH params explicitly, the validator
     catches the self-influence (Code 5001) bug where they are set to
     the same value. Setting only one is fine; defaults are reliable.
  3. An explicit tag_index / influence_target that is not a real country
     tag or tag alias is flagged as an ERROR (a typo such as GBR for ENG
     or the mis-cased CHl for CHI). Scope keywords, var: / event_target:
     refs, array subscripts, numerics, and aliases are accepted.
