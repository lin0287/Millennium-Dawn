"""Regression test for validate_missing_textures in validate_unused_textures.py.

The missing-texture check iterates ``raw_referenced_textures`` — every texture
path as written in a .gfx file. Before that it scanned ``referenced_textures``,
which only held already-resolved on-disk paths, so a reference that resolved to
nothing was never in the set and the check was dead.
