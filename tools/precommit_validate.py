"""Parallel dispatcher for the run-on-commit Millennium Dawn validators.

The commit-stage `md-validate-*` hooks each ran as a separate process, one after
another, and each re-discovered the staged files with its own `git diff`. This
folds them into a single hook that runs them concurrently.

Measurement (the commit-stage set, branch changeset, this machine):

  * serial, one hook after another ... ~1.13s
  * this dispatcher, in parallel ..... ~0.38s

Folding them into ONE process instead was measured to be *slower*: a single
process can only run validators serially, the per-validator full-repo
cross-reference scan (not process startup) dominates, and pooling thousands of
file contents in one `FileOpener` cache adds memory pressure that slows the
CPU-bound parsing. So each validator keeps its own process; the win is running
them at the same time.

This dispatcher:

  * discovers the staged files once and shares them via `MD_STAGED_FILES`, so
    no validator shells out to git;
  * runs only the validators whose file rules match a staged path (mirroring
    each hook's `files:` regex);
  * runs them concurrently, splitting cores between the outer fan-out and each
    validator's own worker pool so the two layers don't oversubscribe.

Only the commit-stage validators live here. The expensive cross-reference
validators run in CI only (never on commit), and must stay out of this
registry, or they would run on every commit — running the full suite on commit
was measured at ~7s warm, a large regression. `validate_defines` keeps its own
pre-commit hook because it is keyed off `.lua` files, which this dispatcher
does not route.

Opt out with `MD_SKIP_VALIDATE=1 git commit ...`.
