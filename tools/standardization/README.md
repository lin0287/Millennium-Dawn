# Millennium Dawn Standardization Tools

This directory contains Python scripts for automatically standardizing HOI4 mod files according to Millennium Dawn coding standards.

## Overview

The standardization tools help maintain consistent code formatting and best practices across the mod. They automatically:

- Format code blocks with proper indentation and spacing
- Add required logging where missing
- Remove performance-hurting code patterns
- Enforce Millennium Dawn specific formatting rules

## Available Standardizers

### Focus Trees (`standardize_focus_tree.py`)

Standardizes national focus files according to Millennium Dawn standards.

**Key features:**

- Enforces proper property ordering
- Adds missing logging to completion rewards and effects
- Formats search_filters into single lines
- Ensures ai_will_do is properly formatted

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 standardize_focus_tree.py input.txt -o output.txt --backup --verbose
```

### Focus ID Prefixes (`rename_focus_ids.py`)

Renames country focus IDs and their references without rewriting unrelated focus formatting.
It scans the repository containing the tool by default; use `--root` for another checkout.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 rename_focus_ids.py \
  --focus-file ../../common/national_focus/05_Australia.txt \
  --localisation-file ../../localisation/english/MD_focus_AST_l_english.yml \
  --tag AST
```

### Events (`standardize_events.py`)

Standardizes event files according to Millennium Dawn standards.

**Key features:**

- Ensures `is_triggered_only = yes` for triggered events
- Adds logging to options only when they have effects
- Maintains proper property ordering
- Removes excessive blank lines

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 standardize_events.py input.txt -o output.txt --backup --verbose
```

### Decisions (`standardize_decisions.py`)

Standardizes decision files according to Millennium Dawn standards.

**Key features:**

- Adds logging to complete_effect blocks
- Enforces proper property ordering
- Maintains consistent formatting
- Preserves ai_will_do blocks

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 standardize_decisions.py input.txt -o output.txt --backup --verbose
```

### Ideas (`standardize_ideas.py`)

Standardizes idea files according to Millennium Dawn standards.

**Key features:**

- Removes redundant default properties (`cancel = { always = no }`). Keeps `allowed = { always = no }` (hides a slotted idea from the picker; `add_idea` still applies it)
- Adds logging to on_add/on_remove when they have effects
- Preserves allowed_civil_war for civil war tags
- Maintains proper formatting

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 standardize_ideas.py input.txt -o output.txt --backup --verbose
```

### Redundant Gate Blocks (`strip_idea_allowed_gates.py`, `strip_dynmod_tag_gates.py`)

Surgical sweeps for two gates that never fail. Unlike the standardizers above they rewrite only the blocks they remove, so the diff carries no reformatting.

`strip_idea_allowed_gates.py` drops `allowed` and `available` blocks from every idea in a category with no slot. Nothing picks from `country` or `hidden_ideas`, so `add_idea` is the only way in and it never consults either gate. Use `cancel` if the idea should remove itself. Categories come from `common/idea_tags/`, so a new slotless one is covered without editing the script.

`strip_dynmod_tag_gates.py` drops `always = yes` and top-level `original_tag` / `tag` triggers from a dynamic modifier's `enable` block, removing the block when that empties it. `enable` is re-evaluated at runtime, so these cost something every pass. Only top-level triggers are touched: one inside `OR` / `NOT` is an alternative or an exclusion, and `country_exists`, `has_idea` and `has_completed_focus` stay, because those go false while the modifier is still attached. Every strip is reported — "only this country ever attaches it" is a claim about the rest of the repo that the script does not verify.

Both find a block's closing brace by column, not by "the line where depth hit zero" — a closer sharing a line with the enclosing block's own `}` would otherwise be swallowed along with it. A block whose braces never balance is reported and left alone, and the run exits non-zero, rather than rewriting from the opener to EOF.

`validate_ideas.py` and `validate_modifiers.py` flag both patterns, so neither grows back silently.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 strip_idea_allowed_gates.py --dry-run
python3 strip_dynmod_tag_gates.py --backup
```

### AI Path Weights (`apply_ai_path_weights.py`)

Writes the `ai_will_do` path modifiers for a country's AI path game rule (issue #3162) from a
mapping of focus id to ownership group, so the two-line boost/killswitch pair does not have to be
hand-written across ~180 focuses. Like the gate sweeps above it rewrites only the blocks it owns.

A modifier is replaced only when it exists to route paths: it names a `<TAG>_*_FOCUS_PATH` flag, a
`<TAG>_ai_*_path` trigger, or is a bare `factor = 0` `is_historical_focus_on` killswitch. Anything
carrying `can_staff_an_*`, `bankruptcy_incoming_collapse` or `ai_is_threatened` is a guard and is
preserved verbatim — `validate_focus_tree.py` scans for those tokens literally and would report a
guard that had been folded into a path trigger as missing.

The emitted pair goes last in the block, because modifiers apply in order and a later `add` would
resurrect a focus the killswitch just zeroed. The run aborts without writing on an unknown or
duplicated focus id, a shared focus file, unbalanced braces, or a rewrite that is not idempotent.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 apply_ai_path_weights.py --tag DEN --map plan.txt --dry-run
python3 apply_ai_path_weights.py --tag DEN --map -
```

Mapping format (`#` comments allowed):

```
group historical owner=DEN_ai_historical_path not=DEN_ai_not_historical_path
group socialist owner_flag=DEN_SOCIALIST_FOCUS_PATH not=DEN_ai_not_socialist_path
boost 25

DEN_join_the_euro historical
DEN_red_bloc socialist 150
DEN_army_reform -
```

Pair it with `tools/analysis/ai_path_report.py`, which decides which focuses belong to which group
and re-checks the result for killswitch orphans.

### Military Industrial Organizations (`standardize_mio.py`)

Standardizes MIO organization files according to Millennium Dawn standards.

**Key features:**

- Enforces the standard property ordering for MIOs
- Orders core fields as `name`, `allowed`, `icon`, `task_capacity`, `equipment_type`, `research_categories`, `tree_header_text`, `initial_trait`, then `trait`
- Compacts blocks by removing excessive blank lines
- Keeps unrecognized lines in a trailing `other` section

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 standardize_mio.py input.txt -o output.txt --backup --verbose
```

## Unified Interface

For convenience, use the unified `standardize.py` script:

```bash
# Standardize focus trees
python3 standardize.py focus input.txt -o output.txt --backup

# Standardize events
python3 standardize.py event input.txt --verbose

# Standardize decisions
python3 standardize.py decision input.txt

# Standardize ideas
python3 standardize.py idea input.txt -v

# Standardize MIOs
python3 standardize.py mio input.txt
```

## Common Options

All standardizers support these command-line options:

- `input_file` - The file to standardize (required)
- `-o, --output` - Output file (default: overwrites input)
- `-b, --backup` - Create backup before modifying (recommended)
- `-v, --verbose` - Verbose output for debugging

## Code Standards Enforced

### All File Types

Every line written by a standardizer passes through `normalize_spacing`
(`tools/shared_utils.py`), which puts single spaces around `{`, `}` and `=`, so
`NOT = {country_exists = ENG}` comes out as `NOT = { country_exists = ENG }`.
Indentation, `"..."` string interiors and `#` comments are left byte-exact.
`tools/linting/fix_styling.py` uses the same helper.

### Focus Trees

- Use `relative_position_id` for positioning
- Include logging in completion_reward/select_effect/bypass_effect
- Proper property ordering (id, icon, position, cost, prerequisites, etc.)
- ai_will_do always last

### Events

- Use `is_triggered_only = yes` for triggered events
- Log only options that have actual effects
- Proper property ordering
- Remove excessive blank lines

### Decisions

- Include logging in complete_effect
- Use `fire_only_once` sparingly
- Proper property ordering
- Include ai_will_do

### Ideas

- Keep `allowed = { always = no }` on slotted ideas (hides them from the picker; `add_idea` still applies them)
- Remove `cancel = { always = no }` (redundant default; checked hourly, never true)
- Remove empty `on_add = { log = "" }`
- Include `allowed_civil_war = { always = yes }` for civil war tags
- Log only when on_add/on_remove have actual effects

### Military Industrial Organizations

- Proper property ordering for organization headers
- Place all `tree_header_text` blocks before `initial_trait`
- Place all `trait` blocks after `initial_trait`
- Remove excessive blank lines inside blocks

## Performance Optimizations

The standardizers automatically remove or optimize code patterns that hurt performance:

- **Division operations**: Suggest multiplication instead of division
- **Empty logging**: Remove `log = ""` statements
- **MTTH events**: Warn about open-fire MTTH events
- **Arrays**: Suggest replacing `every_country`/`random_country` with specific arrays

## Architecture

The standardization tools use a modular architecture:

- `common_utils.py` - Shared utilities and base classes
- `BaseStandardizer` - Abstract base class for all standardizers
- Individual standardizer classes inherit from `BaseStandardizer`
- Each standardizer implements specific formatting rules for its file type

## Contributing

When adding new standardizers:

1. Inherit from `BaseStandardizer`
2. Implement `get_block_pattern()`, `extract_properties()`, and `format_block()`
3. Follow the existing code patterns
4. Add appropriate logging and error handling
5. Update this README with usage instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors**: Make sure you're running from the `tools/standardization/` directory

```bash
cd tools/standardization
python3 standardize.py focus input.txt
```

**File not found**: Verify the input file path is correct

```bash
ls -la input.txt  # Check if file exists
```

**Permission errors**: Ensure you have write permissions for the output directory

```bash
chmod 644 input.txt  # Make sure file is writable
```

### Debug Mode

Use `--verbose` to see detailed processing information:

```bash
python3 standardize.py focus input.txt --verbose
```

This will show:

- Files being processed
- Blocks being reformatted
- Properties being extracted
- Formatting decisions being made

## Integration with Development Workflow

No standardizer runs automatically. The `md-standardize` pre-commit hook is
disabled on purpose: it rewrites whole files, so on a repo where most files
predate the current rules it would drag a full reformat into every unrelated
commit. Run the standardizers by hand on the files you are working on.

What runs instead is `tools/validation/validate_standardization.py`, which
_reports_ the files a standardizer would rewrite without touching them. It is
warning-only and scoped to changed files, in pre-commit (through
`tools/precommit_validate.py`) and in CI (a `core`-batch step). Each finding
names the command that fixes it:

```
events/Gulf.txt - not standardized - run: python3 tools/standardization/standardize.py event "events/Gulf.txt"
```

Pass `--all` for a full-repo sweep instead of the changed-file scope.

### standardize_api.py

`standardize_api.py` is the in-memory entry point both the validator and the
(disabled) `tools/standardize_staged.py` hook drive, so path routing and
standardizer selection live in one place:

- `kind_for_path(path)` — `"focus"`, `"event"`, `"decision"`, `"idea"`, `"mio"`,
  or `None` when no standardizer owns the path.
- `standardize_text(kind, text)` — the text the standardizer would write, or
  `None` when the file holds no block of that kind.

Neither reads or writes the file, so a checker can compare against disk without
the risk of a half-written file.
