"""Reshape the energy technology buffs in ``common/technologies/industry.txt`` into
calibrated logistic S-curves, so the most cost-effective power source over time is:

    fossil  <2015<  nuclear (fission)  <2020<  renewable  <2060<  nuclear (fusion) forever

WHY / DESIGN
------------
"Cost-effectiveness" is power per build cost:

    metric = base_GW * state_factor(renewable only) * (1 + cumulative power techs)
                                                     / (base_cost / (1 + cumulative construction-speed techs))

with the building stats from ``common/buildings/00_buildings.txt`` (renewable 0.5 GW /
50000 cost, nuclear 4 GW / 50000, fossil 2 GW / 9500) evaluated at state factor 1.0.
See ``tools/analysis/renewable_power_per_cost.py`` for the chart and the full model,
and ``.claude/docs/energy-power-balance.md`` for the design write-up.

Each source's cumulative tech buff (both the power-output modifier and the
construction-speed modifier) is a logistic S-curve in calendar year:

  * Fossil   - ONE S-curve starting LOW (~0.25 @1990) and steepened so the 1990s-2010s techs
               each give a worthwhile bonus, reaching the same efficiency as before by 2020;
               small total gain, less game-start advantage.
  * Renewable- ONE S-curve starting at the bottom, shifted early enough to cross fossil by
               2020 (steep rise across the 2010s-2020s techs, plateaus by ~2040).
  * Nuclear  - TWO stacked S-curves: fission (rises ~1990-2015) then fusion (rises
               ~2050-2065), so nuclear leads twice.

Per-source amplitudes are SOLVED (scipy.brentq) to put the three crossovers exactly on
2015 / 2020 / 2060; speed amplitude = ``SPEED_RATIO`` * power amplitude per source.

CONSIDERATIONS (things this model deliberately does / omits)
-----------------------------------------------------------
  * Build cost is ``base_cost`` (civ-factory construction effort), NOT the in-game "$"
    (that is foreign investment / income, a separate system).
  * The renewable monthly random(0..1) is NOT in the metric - in game a renewable plant
    averages ~half its rated output, which shifts the renewable crossovers a little later.
  * Fuel upkeep is excluded (renewable 0, nuclear 40/wk, fossil 480/day) - it only makes
    renewables look better, so the crossovers here are conservative for renewables.
  * "Average metric across sources per year" is kept broadly stable and is much flatter
    late-game than the old exponential design (renewable peak ~6.3e-4 vs old ~1.87e-3).

POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK
---------------------
  * The renewable rise is spread across the 2010s-2020s techs (no single mega-tech), but its
    S-curve plateaus by ~2040, so renewables_11-13 (2060-2080) grant only token gains (floored to
    0.001). Re-tuning R_T/R_K trades breakthrough sharpness against the length of that dead tail.
  * Nuclear's fission/fusion split is purely numeric here; the reactor* techs / loc could be
    re-themed (reactor1-8 fission, reactor9-12 fusion) to match.
  * Re-tune by editing the SHAPE/RATIO/PF constants below and re-running --apply; the chart
    in tools/analysis confirms the crossovers.
  * Hydro/geothermal are separate systems and are not modelled here.
