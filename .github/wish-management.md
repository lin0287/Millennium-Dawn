# Wish management

Every wish for Millennium Dawn is a GitHub issue. The council manages them on one Project
board, "Millennium Dawn Wishes". This page records the fields, the views, the monthly
check, and the commands used to build the board.

## Rules the board enforces (2.1)

- One rework before two new countries per developer.
- A tagteam is two assignees on one issue.
- Every claimed wish has a council mentor.
- Every assignee hears from the council at least once a quarter.

## Where each field lives

| Field          | Lives in            | Values                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type           | repo label          | `type:new-country`, `type:rework`                                                                                  |
| Region         | repo label          | `region:africa`, `region:latin-america`, `region:east-asia`, `region:middle-east`, `region:europe`, `region:other` |
| Target         | milestone           | `2.1`, `3.0`, or none for backlog                                                                                  |
| Stage          | board `Status`      | Wish, Claimed, In progress, Review, Done                                                                           |
| Council mentor | board single select | GitHub handles of the council                                                                                      |
| Last check-in  | board date          | Set at the quarterly ping                                                                                          |
| Developers     | assignees           | One, or two for a tagteam                                                                                          |

`issue-triage.yml` sets the Type and Region labels from the Kind and Region answers of
the Focus Trees form.

## Views

| View               | Layout | Filter or grouping                      | Question it answers                       |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Wish pool          | table  | `status:Wish no:assignee`               | What is waiting for triage?               |
| Per dev            | board  | group by Assignees, `-status:Done`      | Who has two countries open and no rework? |
| Region coverage    | board  | group by Region label, `-status:Done`   | Where are the gaps?                       |
| Per council member | board  | group by Council mentor, `-status:Done` | Who mentors too much or nothing?          |

## Monthly council check

1. Open Per dev. Any developer with two `type:new-country` and no `type:rework` gets no new
   country until a rework closes.
2. Open Per council member. Rebalance mentors so no one carries more than a handful.
3. Open Region coverage. Flag empty regions to the Discord.
4. Sort claimed wishes by Last check-in. Add `needs-check-in` to any quiet for 90 days,
   ping the assignee, and set Last check-in to today. Remove the label once they reply.
   Nothing is closed.

## Building the board

The board is <https://github.com/orgs/MillenniumDawn/projects/7>.

```
gh project create --owner MillenniumDawn --title "Millennium Dawn Wishes"
gh project field-create 7 --owner MillenniumDawn --name "Council mentor" \
  --data-type SINGLE_SELECT \
  --single-select-options "AngriestBird,Blazer135,TemplarGeneral,MrP0tter,KianGhk1530"
gh project field-create 7 --owner MillenniumDawn --name "Last check-in" --data-type DATE
gh project field-list 7 --owner MillenniumDawn --format json \
  --jq '.fields[] | select(.name=="Status") | .id'
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { updateProjectV2Field(input: { fieldId: "<id>",
  singleSelectOptions: [ {name: "Wish", color: GRAY, description: ""},
  {name: "Claimed", color: BLUE, description: ""}, {name: "In progress", color: YELLOW, description: ""},
  {name: "Review", color: ORANGE, description: ""}, {name: "Done", color: GREEN, description: ""} ] })
  { projectV2Field { ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField { name } } } }'
```

Views have no API; create the four views above in the UI. Adding a mentor is
Settings > Council mentor > add option. The `PROJECT_PAT` repository secret must be able
to write to the project.
